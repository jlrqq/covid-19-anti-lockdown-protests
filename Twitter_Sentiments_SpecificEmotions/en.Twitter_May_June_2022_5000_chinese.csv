 China imposed a continuous lockdown on Shanghai. Not only did it not contain the spread of the epidemic, but it also hit Shanghai's economy hard. In particular, many small and micro enterprises are facing extinction. Independent economist Gong Shengli said that the cost of the closure of the Shanghai epidemic is as high as 10 billion yuan per day.
