I live in AZ and the particular area I live in has a high density of veterans and “patriots” so you have the firearms, IBAs, sunscreen, mosquito repellants, and some bear sprays (better than pepper spray and the rest isn’t all that common.) 

The thing you may not know is the metal mining industry is an economic powerhouse in AZ. In my area it’s everything. Take out one of the several medium to large mines in AZ and it would be substantial economically.

With that it’s common for a large portion of the AZ population to also have to wear steel toed boots, hi vis vests, eye protection, hearing protection, jeans (nothing else is allowed), hand protection, seatbelts, and all the other no brainer PPE any day they work.

Even with that at several sites I visit they have had employees refuse to wear a mask. The explanation for refusal has been anything from “I have rights” to “but the president doesn’t.” The company (one of the largest in the state) just responded it’s an expectation of employment and added it to the PPE policy that has no flexibility.

If the state can tell you what you MUST wear on your body it can tell you what can do inside your body, too.

I was under the impression that we have the right to our bodies. For years I fought for this, for trans people to change their bodies, for women to have reproductive choices--each time people would explain why ""society"" suffers or might suffer. I believed in individual liberty then and I believe in it now.

I could catch someone from someone. I might die from it. My mother might die from the cancer surgery she can't get because it got postponed over COVID concerns. Yes, people may always die from anything--from cops, from protests, from looting, from diseases. That is in fact life. 

People will get COVID while protesting. They will get COVID while attending Trump Rallies. They will get COVID from their mailman.

We haven't had relief in SO LONG and now, the $3.3 trillion relief plan that was suggested is the only thing that makes sense at this point. 



I lost my job in march when I got covid. I finally though my life was going somewhere, dreams of affording college and maybe a down payment on a tiny home someday. But they let me go once I told them I got covid. They promised to hire me back when I recovered. 



After I ""recovered"" from covid, I got bronchitis. I now have permanent lung damage and can't do much of anything without becoming winded and my chest hurting. Little things like emptying the dishwasher or getting the mail wipe me out. I'm barely 30 years old for fucks sake! And I was in the best shape of my life pre-covid, working out 6 days a week (3 days strength training / 3 days HIIT cardio). 



When I recovered ""enough"" in May to try returning to work, I contacted my old job and they said they had ""no recollection of ever saying"" they'd hire me back. So I started sending out rapid fire job applications. 



Unfortunately by that time, so many jobs had downsized or closed due to covid, I've been screwed ever since. I've sent out over 400 job applications since may (I've stopped counting after i hit 400 a while back, too discouraging) and Ive only had a handful of interviews, but the position's always go to people with double bachelor's or masters or something crazy like that because these people also lost their jobs and are way overqualified for the work they're applying for. 



I can often see how many applicants there are for certain jobs and many of them have *thousands* of applicants for 1-3 positions.....




So for months now I've been skipping many meals (I usually eat one meal a day, skip the next, then one meal the following day) or sometimes I'll eat 2 meals a day for a week and then nothing but water for the following week, then revert back, just trying to stretch out my drained savings. I also had to empty my 401k too and take the massive tax hit on that so now my future is destroyed too. That's all gone now as well.



I'm royally fucked now. I lose my car and my home at the end of this month, right before Xmas and among the coldest months of the year. I don't have health insurance nor do I have a job and I only make $216 a week from Unemployment when I used to make SIGNIFICANTLY more than that when working. I also can't rely on my family because they all excommunicated me after learning I was voting for Biden (they are absolutely rabid T**** supporters and think I am helping doom this country and that I'm a satanic anti-patriot. Subreddit doesn't like me using political terms so I'm trying to avoid it). 



I'm about to just give up. I can't handle it anymore. I've sold just about everything that has any value to me, including my retro video game collection, my gaming laptop and most of my modern video game collection as well. Even some sentimental things like the vintage Nat Geo complete leather bound set my grandfather gave me before he passed (1980-1990, complete). I'm so fucking depressed every day I just wake up a little later than I usually do and just lie in bed staring at the ceiling fighting off tears and suicidal thoughts.

I lost my job in march when I got covid. I finally though my life was going somewhere, dreams of affording college and maybe a down payment on a tiny home someday. But they let me go once I told them I got covid. They promised to hire me back when I recovered. 



After I ""recovered"" from covid, I got bronchitis. I now have permanent lung damage and can't do much of anything without becoming winded and my chest hurting. Little things like emptying the dishwasher or getting the mail wipe me out. I'm barely 30 years old for fucks sake! And I was in the best shape of my life pre-covid, working out 6 days a week (3 days strength training / 3 days HIIT cardio). 



When I recovered ""enough"" in May to try returning to work, I contacted my old job and they said they had ""no recollection of ever saying"" they'd hire me back. So I started sending out rapid fire job applications. 



Unfortunately by that time, so many jobs had downsized or closed due to covid, I've been screwed ever since. I've sent out over 400 job applications since may (I've stopped counting after i hit 400 a while back, too discouraging) and Ive only had a handful of interviews, but the position's always go to people with double bachelor's or masters or something crazy like that because these people also lost their jobs and are way overqualified for the work they're applying for. 



I can often see how many applicants there are for certain jobs and many of them have *thousands* of applicants for 1-3 positions.....




So for months now I've been skipping many meals (I usually eat one meal a day, skip the next, then one meal the following day) or sometimes I'll eat 2 meals a day for a week and then nothing but water for the following week, then revert back, just trying to stretch out my drained savings. I also had to empty my 401k too and take the massive tax hit on that so now my future is destroyed too. That's all gone now as well.



I'm royally fucked now. I lose my car and my home at the end of this month, right before Xmas and among the coldest months of the year. I don't have health insurance nor do I have a job and I only make $216 a week from Unemployment when I used to make SIGNIFICANTLY more than that when working. I also can't rely on my family because they all excommunicated me after learning I was voting for Biden (they are absolutely rabid T**** supporters and think I am helping doom this country and that I'm a satanic anti-patriot. Subreddit doesn't like me using political terms so I'm trying to avoid it). 



I'm about to just give up. I can't handle it anymore. I've sold just about everything that has any value to me, including my retro video game collection, my gaming laptop and most of my modern video game collection as well. Even some sentimental things like the vintage Nat Geo complete leather bound set my grandfather gave me before he passed (1980-1990, complete). I'm so fucking depressed every day I just wake up a little later than I usually do and just lie in bed staring at the ceiling fighting off tears and suicidal thoughts.

- You didn’t need hospital enterprises running with everything from doctors and nurses to repair technicians, janitors, and all else

- You didn’t need garbage workers picking up your trash, and landfill workers disposing of it

It's ridiculous that people are still trying to live their lives like nothing is happening. It's like nobody cares that people are dying. 1000+ people a day. Likely more. 

This is not a problem that is difficult nor expensive to solve. It doesn't need a medical breakthrough, or miracle cure. 

It's a problem that several other countries,  poorer, with less medical resources, less tech and high population densities than America have already solved, through multiple methods. 


One proposed solution, for America and the world is this : 

We need a full lock down. Absolutely everyone except the bare minimum staying home. 

Govt can print money or issue bonds or food stamps to give people enough time and money to buy food. The US govt has already thrown away 4 Trillion without any results. Let's try to do it properly this time.

Rent /mortgage and utilities can be paused, again at government expense. 

Emergency quarantine hospitals built so infected are seperated from healthy people. 

Mass testing done, zone by zone to identify the infected. (You can test groups of people to identify if there are infected in those groups, then do individual tests when this is true). 

Once each zone is cleared, travel restrictions from uncleared zones. 

Once the more developed states / countries get it done, we help the less developed guys. 

This is a fucking GLOBAL PANDEMIC, it's gonna take a global effort to fix it.

In America, a country with 330million people that has spent [4trillion dollars](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/15/coronavirus-economy-6-trillion/) trying to solve Covid, has around 1000 people dying a day, and 100,000 people getting infected every day. 

EVERY DAY. 

This should be taken as a warning to others.

4 Trillion dollars is around USD12,000 per American. 

What if they pooled half of that to make a pause on bills and rent and mortgage and utilities for 6 weeks, and gave USD6,000 to every American and asked them to stay home for 6 weeks? Give everybody some time to stock up food and stuff. 

Massive fines for anybody caught outside (except medical emergencies). Only medical and emergency personal allowed out. Sick people get quarantined away from healthy people in hotels. 

Without being able to spread to new hosts, I'm sure we would be able to wipe out the coronavirus, and maybe kick a few other diseases in the balls too. 

Would 6000 dollars, and all your bills paid for 6 weeks be enough to bribe you to stay home for 6 weeks?",1

Our govt handled it really well. Our states largely controlled things and fed offered help around income support and letting army man checkpoints. 

We literally closed borders for many states or made travel highly restrictive to essential or local (people living on border) travel only.

Most states did really well. A couple didn't and of course the main one was also the once complaining about closed borders.

I was in a state that dealt with it quickly and we live normally now with minimal restriction. Im yet to meet a person not glad we did it, though at the time there were plenty of complaints. Doing it fast and hard seems the best economic solution too as it doesnt drag out restrictions.

Its amazing US can't look around the world and go, hey look these 4 countries did it really well, how about we implement similar policy. This should not be political yet somehow it is.

Plenty of people think fast food and big box stores are “essential” and would expect them (and the wage slaves) to still be there. 

Plenty also think either their job is essential, or that they’ll be paid to take a month off to stay home. We’ve already seen the ratfucker GOP party say they’d rather see wage slaves dead than paid a living wage, so why do you think they’d give out money for free?

Like so many of these stupid “polls” it’s worded in such a way that people fill in the blank in their head and agree with it.

A lockdown will take down many restaurants, pubs and other businesses. Friends and people you know will lose their jobs.

If you are a tenant you may have to hope your landlord is benevolent enough to accept this or that government policy disallows evictions during lockdown. In that latter case if you have property mortgages and rely on rent to sustain them you had better have a lot of surplus cash lying around.

Our income primarily comes from rents, however that barely covers operating costs. Maintenance is paid for from donations of past students. 

Collections have been a major battle. Students and parents just don’t pay and I can’t evict. Taking students to court for rent is an exercise in futility. 

If there is another lock down - I’m walking away from this program. There is no one else to run it. I’ll let the bank know where the keys are. 

I’m done with this shit.",1

Lockdowns would have been more successful if we had a national mask mandate that was enforced along with more effective testing early on.

Even now, crime is sky high, and basic city services are hardly functioning. 

As cynical as this sounds, people simply cannot be unemployed and left to their own devices.

All Chinese Scientist, mixing Carp and Bat Genomes that introduce, yes, Corona Virus. 

Aka: HIV + SARS..

================

Identification of Coronavirus Sequences in Carp cDNA from Wuhan, China

Journal of Medical Virology, published March 11.

If confirmed with other research, it suggests SARS-2 might be a product of genetic engineering. Bats and carp don't consort that much in nature. This is being low key censored because it would make the public go ape shit.

EDIT: to add the following excerpt

SARS-CoV-2 were identified in two separate cDNA pools. The first pool was from a Carassius auratus (crusian carp) cell line and the second was from Ctenopharyngodon idella(grass carp) head kidney tissue (6, 7)

Turns out both these samples to the database were submitted from Wuhan.

So let's examine some of the coincidences so far:

-- a new bat derived coronavirus appears in a market close to the only lab in China known to be working with bat derived corona viruses

-- the new virus has a bizarre genetic overlap with the carp genome

-- the carp genome was submitted by researchers working out of Wuhan

-- the new virus has slight but functionally important genetic similarities to HIV; not a smoking gun, but the only coronavirus with said mutation... but wait! no there is one in nature with this mutation... published Jan 20, after the outbreak started... from researchers working out of -- you guessed it -- Wuhan

I won't explicitly say it, because people get banned and censored for doing so, and more importantly, these days I am happy if I can simply get my aged mother and people like her to avoid gatherings and wear a mask. I don't want to distance myself further from the mainstream narration. There isn't too much to be gained focusing on the origin at this point. That will need to come later though. We want to deal with this in a way that doesn't devolve into letting nukes fly.

They will be this way or another, it's just a matter of time.

My company in Poland produces machines that fill, cap and label the chemical and food products, also the ones for decontamination. We already suspended all service visits to our customers for at least 2 weeks. If the machines get malfunction, the producer is on it's own and we can't help them. Imagine all machines stop this way and no help from service guys. The production is down, the shops have no products. This is a snow ball effect.

Therefore don't tell us lies, because FACTORIES AND OTHER PLACES OF WORK **WILL BE CLOSED,** if this problem will not be solved quickly. Mark my words.",0

Lots of factories and offices are also lessening the crowding by changing shift/work hours etc.

We work as IT consultants and three of us we were supposed to go to a customer, instead only one went and we were given a desk at 3mt distance from everyone else, mandatory hand sanitizer at the entrance.

It's the same problem China is having right now.

Probably just food production, food distribution and groceries, pharmacies, hospitals, police, fire, utilities, communication.  Everyone else go on self quarantine.  This solves the problem of recirculating the virus.  It would be a lot cheaper than all the countries individually managing different stages of the disease curve for god knows how long.  I guarantee the stock markets would shoot up the day it was announced.

Part II

Some type of universal basic income for one month.   This would have to be a country by country solution, but ideally it would keep people from rioting.   I'm thinking something like $2k per every US citizen over 18 for example.  This is roughly minimum wage.  That's something like $400Billion.  There has already been way more than that lost.

If we destroy the economy lives will be lost due an increase in poverty, violence and who knows what else. Delaying the spread doesnt ensure that the infected wont die looking at how it is likely required treatment becomes unavailable since production chains are broken.

If we let the virus infect everyone the healthcare will collapse for about 1-2 months, 1-5% of infected will die and the survivors will protect those who didnt catch it up with their herd immunity.

While it sounds drastic, even with the clarifications from other posters \['FACTORIES AND OTHER PLACES OF WORK WILL **NOT** BE CLOSED'\], it was probably needed.  


I wonder what would be a reasonable time frame to expect the numbers to slow down.  We all know the estimated incubation time until symptoms (5-7 on average, with outliers at 3 up to 14 days). Can this be used as indicator as to when the scary increases in cases decelerates?   


In any case, I wish all our Italian friends all the best. It's sad to see one of Europe's richest cultural cradles in this situation. Or in fact, any country of course \^\^

I’m a physician in the US and most of our clinics have no way to order COVID-19 tests. Even if we could order them, we can’t collect the swabs because we don’t have isolation rooms or PPE and if we tested just one person who came back positive we would need to self- quarantine and shut down entire clinics.

The hospitals aren’t faring any better. We just started getting updates about COVID-19 protocols within the last week and we are still scrambling to decide where to put these patients, whether or not we let trainees treat them, what limits we need to place on ICU care, etc. Many areas are running low on blood because the blood drives have all shut down and I don’t think most people realize how little it would take to overwhelm the US healthcare system. My hospital runs at 95-100% capacity at any time. We often have NO ICU beds that aren’t already in use. And we are a large referral center. It’s currently a 3 day wait for patients from other hospitals to even find a bed here. Give us another 100 patients and people will die, not because we can’t treat their disease, but because we will not have enough resources to do so.",0

Blood tests while not accurate were being fielded for testing, wonder if monkey genes equal immunity to corona.   

I believe they should provide more information before making decisions on our behalf.  If we can rule out folks that are immune to virus than we can focus on protecting those the virus is applicable to instead of scaring the children and increasing the value of Doritos.

Not always without issues, but by and large has enabled people to remain indoors.

It's perfectly doable from an economic/financial perspective in high income countries, and likely makes financial sense given the costs associated with a run away pandemic.

I can see that in lower income countries these things are much more difficult to achieve, both financially and in terms of the infrastructure and logistics needed to implement them. I'd be interested in what measures those places could take instead. I'd suspect it's the usual combination of social distancing, hand washing, masks.",0

Then there's the fact that enforcement of it will be next to impossible (except for maybe house parties and business's) due to a lack of community trust of police. And also a 2nd lockdown wouldn't even be that effective if lets say %50 of the population still met up with their friends. I mean the bay area for an example was the first to shutdown and is still largely in shutdown yet the curve was never flattened. If the Bay Area couldn't flatten the curve with the first shutdown why would a 2nd shutdown do any better.

To know how close a hospital is to reaching capacity? To knowing how close we are to a ventilator ""shortage."" Because the entire point of locking down was to ""slow the curve"" and not overwhelm our medical industry, not ""stay inside and wait for a cure."" So I don't think we should be preparing to lockdown for cases spiking if we still have plenty of hospital space and resources. If cases are going up because people are getting it but handling it just fine without a hospital visit, that's a very different thing I believe.

The case count rising in some places may not mean that the health system will be overloaded. I'm not suggesting that we should  eliminate all mitigation measures but reverting back to a ""lockdown"" will have significant downstream effects that we should make sure it's actually warranted. We aren't seeing many hospitals across the country being overwhelmed at the moment which may be a function of younger, healthier people making up the new cases.

Try this out with your friends and refer to this document by group and section number to see where they fall on the spectrum.

Group A: 

1.) modified TEMPORARY lockdown (I.e ability to lockdown rapidly in the event hospitalization rates reach critical levels)

2.) essential businesses remain open

3.) gradual reopening of non-essential businesses based on regional cases/variables. 

4.) federal and state level financial support for affected businesses and populations. (Divert some of the spending from defense et. al. to this crisis and pretend that just maybe the virus is like a global terrorist

a.) yes this means we will have to pay it off in the long run,

b.)yes we have as a nation have done it before

c.) no it’s not the end of the world to take out a loan on ourselves.

5.) use of masks and distancing in places of business as standard practice. Because it’s:

a.) now widely evident to be effective against this virus.

b.) Based on peer reviewed data (scientists proof checking other scientists not google searches).

c.) based on the concepts of PPE, and BSI that healthcare providers have effectively relied on since modern medicine.

6.) science based

7.) similar approaches have been shown to work when used all over the world.

8.) repeating the above steps until an effective treatment (plasma therapy, antiviral etc.) and or vaccine is widely available.

9.) again science based

10.) based on preserving as much human life as reasonably possible. Which means:

a.) accepting not everyone can be saved.

b.) accepting we can put in measures that both mitigate loss of life and money.

c.) accepting that life is more important then money.


Group B:


1.) wants the to keep nearly all businesses open for the sake of the economy. 

a.) fails to realize that in a war attrition the economy loses as more people are hospitalized and die I.e can’t show up to work.

b.) Not considered a sound strategy from actual economists in the long run.

2.) argues against government assistance as a long term plan, for again the sake of the economy because:

a.) Not wanting to have more “debt” even though that is what we accumulate from nearly every war and defense project both necessary and unnecessary. 

b.) fails to realize defense spending is cited as it makes up over half of the entire US federal discretionary spending every year.

3.) wants all of the above things but also does not want to have to wear a mask or social distance either because:

a.)doesn’t believe it works (not scientifically supported).

b.)doesn’t want to be “forced” to.

c.) doesn’t want to be inconvenienced to.

d.) led by others to believe one or all of the above.

4.) downplays and or ignores/refutes science without providing alternative peer reviewed data. You may see these examples as.

a.) “I don’t know anyone who has the virus.

b.) “it’s practically the same thing as the flu”

c.) “the death rate is 0.5% I’ll take my chances on behalf of everyone else”.

d.) “what about that one time when.....”

e.) “do you have any sources?”

f.) “I don’t believe those sources...what about...”

5.) is fine with accepting however many deaths will unnecessarily occur as long as it’s not them and the economy is ok. *see Group B: 1-A, 1-B

6.) again, not based in science.",1

In NYC and in lockdown since early March. Food shop about once every two weeks. Starbucks (pick-up only, now that they’re open again) and dinner delivery once a week. Aside from that my only outside my apartment thing is sitting in the park, on my own chair apart from everyone and with N95 mask on, once or twice a week to get some sun. That’s it. No travel, no shopping, no haircuts, no other contact. Saw my mom once since March. Working full time and in school. My life is endless zoom calls. 

Yes, it sucks.

People don't spread viruses outbreak-style at work.
The real spread is at malls, grocery shopping, retail, conferences, protests, etc where they interact with lots of people they *don't* normally on a day-to-day basis.

Too many people took their check and continued to engage in risky behaviour.

American ""lockdowns"" were useless and a failure.
Returning to that is absurd.

If we want to fight the virus seriously, maybe a real lockdown would help.
But don't give funding to people unless they're *really* staying home.
And ultimately, we need to move to a mask-based solution (good masks, not the garbage).",1

Barring medical contraindications, I'd like to see a requirement that eligible adults of any household with school-age children are required to be vaccinated before that child could attend public school.

There is strong scientific evidence, that infection and transmission below under 14 is very low. Children or teachers whom test positive are almost certainly bringing this from home. 

14 and above is a different case altogether. These groups maybe more prone to COVID like adults and frankly, and this is just my opinion, are terrible at social distancing.

The key thing to remember about education is that it's not childcare and people need to stop spreading disinformation on this point. That includes teachers whom seem to have forgotten their role here (thankfully that's a tiny minority ranting on Facebook). The majority of teachers are doing amazing work here and should be proud of what they have achieved.

Education is a foundational building block of modern society. It teaches children and young adults the key social skills and professional skills required to develop themselves and society. It is so good for their mental development and wellbeing that in most countries made it LAW that children must attend school.  Finally, there are children from broken homes that see schools and universities as a safe space (and food) away from those issues. I guess you didn't ask this question but I thinks it's important to have a balanced discussion on the power of education institutions and why governments are trying to keep them open.",0

In theory, if you have 100% lockdown, numbers would be near 0 in 2 weeks. Since every infected person would not spread it. Now, 100% lockdown isn't possible, so it would take longer, but this is important to know, because even short lockdowns can turn numbers around.

This is no different to any other restriction. Weeks late, below the minimum advised by scientific councils, geared around upsetting as few people as possible, and guaranteed to be repeated again shortly.

The pandenic goes on and on because it never really stops. And the economic benefits supposedly gained by not locking down are wiped out by dragging it out and making it worse.

And now Wales, in the midst of their own lockdown is fuming at the fact that they could have been part of a coordinated effort, the north and Scotland is fuming that theyve been short-changed in the government compensation available, and London is fuming because they've been working really hard to try and manage a return to business (with allowances) and all of that work has now been set back by months with little to no gains.

A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened...  
The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging.  

Use media to increase sense of personal threat  
Use media to increase sense of responsibility to others   
Use and promote social approval for desired behaviours  
Consider use of social disapproval for failure  to comply    

Social disapproval from one’s community can play an important role in preventing anti-social behaviour or discouraging failure to enact pro-social behaviour

The ages of 50 and above especially 75 upwards, how are they contracting it and where are the figures from?

My wife is a nurse and she has been doing flu clinics for the past few months and all of her elderly patients are self isolating so unless it's in care homes or these old folk are sneaking about without protection why are the figures so high for the over 50s?

One other issue is that somewhere like Cornwall and to a lesser extent the southwest, going into lockdown even though cases per 100000 are significantly lower than everywhere else in the country, makes no sense.

The first lockdown showed that Cornwall missed the big outbreak and even when it lifted for the summer case numbers were extremley rare. All this lockdown will do is prolong the suffering of those who are fit and healthy and unable to make a living, not to mention winter already been a miserable time of year for mental health issues.

I don't envy the government's task because they are stuck between a rock and a hard place but they need to be realistic and maybe accept the fact that we need to live with covid and carry on with our lives.",1

The coronavirus largely does not cause deaths or severe illness in young fit and healthy people. They are being prevented from enjoying the prime years of their lives by a bunch of old folk in govt who are denying them freedoms. These people will not be as impacted and so have no idea how mentally strenous and incapacitating lockdown is for us. I am a young adult and it is having such an effect on my mental health. My gym is shut, the ability to socialise is gone, nothing to look forward to, can’t visit my loved elderly who want to see me and could die any day who are saying they would rather spend time and risk it, 

I spoke to some kids and a husband who are forcing their mother to stay in her bedroom and isolate, she is terrifed and cannot speak english so is very vulnerable. She is getting food through the door and nothing else. 

This is no way to live, the elderly and vulnerable who want to isolate should do so and the rest of us who want to take our chances be allowed to.

I think i have already got the virus but because the symptoms are mild or even non present in a lot of people needed no treatment. 

This is the one scenario in which I agree with Nigel Farage - and that is saying something!",1

Testing is constantly being done and is increasing. More centers open every week. Many of which aren’t at capacity because people aren’t feeling symptoms. Asymptomatic people are getting testing. Antibody testing is being conducted. Our hospital capacity has not been exceeded. The vast majority of people hospitalized and those who died are 65+ who have multiple pre-existing conditions. The long term care facilities are on lockdown and the primary area for most serious cases. 

Beaches have now been opened for 2 weeks. Restaurants opened for 2 weeks. Numbers aren’t skyrocketing or showing increase. 

The numbers for deaths are wildly inaccurate to either direction. I’m assuming you think numbers of reported cases and deaths are too low. Clearly Florida is just lying, the governor and thousands of health officials and medical personnel are all in some giant conspiracy.  If they were lying, wouldn’t more bodies be piling up?  

However, there are some serious questions about if the actual cause of death in many of the reported cases are actually covid related. Multiple heath officials, namely Dr Birx, have stated that a covid death is someone who tested positive, but that does not have to be the actual cause of death. Colorado’s governor has questioned death totals in his state, is it not possible that same thing is happening in other places?",1

1. The country is not as it was. There's still a lot of restrictions, no pubs, no discos, no massive events or agglomerations.

2. The country is more prepared to detect, trace and isolate new cases that it was before. 

3. Population have learn, wash more their hands, use masks and practice social distance.

4. The country know the virus is there. One of the biggest problems in europe was that covid came along with the flu season, so it went unnoticed for months. Now we know it's there. So we can take measures, like doctors taking precautions when someone calls with compatible symptoms.


All this helps to reduce the R0 so (hopefully) it won't spread as much as it did in march/april.

Travel is a big economical boost to poorer countries. Look at Bali without tourists coming from Australia. It's a disaster. International travel to those countries should be encouraged, since the damage done by lack of tourists is bigger than by spreading covid there. I thought that travel is good for mental health. Don't we care about mental health? Myself, I only travelled inside my country last year, to not deal with tests and quarantines. If I would travel abroad, I would likely have to be tested. Why can't I enjoy travelling after testing negative? How is travelling into my country somehow less of a covid spreader event than travelling to let's say Greece for holidays? Seriously, 1 random person in random country is just 1 random person walking around, it doesn't matter if I was in Greece or in Poland yesterday.",1

Everyone was kind of surprised when the state of emergency wasn't extended. However, most people I work with were already preparing for a second lockdown because any sane person would realize the first wasn't long enough and this was just going to happen again.

Sure enough, two weeks later, we're in a second lockdown. Hokkaido is enormous and really sparse so it has that working for its benefit. Most cases seem to be occurring in Asahikawa and Sapporo. In Sapporo, at least, there was a cluster at a cancer center, high school, and now possibly an elementary school. Last night we had a big message from the governer on every channel of ""STAY HOME. DON'T GO TO SAPPORO FOR GOLDEN WEEK."" 

However, while most events are cancelled, it sounds like most businesses will pretend to be open again on the 11th. I'm predicting a 3rd lockdown before the end of the month.",1

That’s probably part of it. I think at that time hardly anyone took it serious. Yes, there were some small changes, more people wearing masks and hand sanitizer placed in front of stores. But there was hardly any telework, restaurants, izakaya’s, pachinko parlors, non-essential shops and what not were still busy with people. During the first lockdown people where still traveling abroad and there was no tests or quarantine for people coming into Hokkaido. I’ll never forget the 2 old folks in Sapporo who decided to go to Europe in early March. Came back to Hokkaido, took domestic flights and trains. Less then a week later both tested positive for the virus....
Now things have changed. Cashiers have protective shields and are wearing gloves, a lot of restaurants are closed but offering takeout, a lot of office jobs have gone to telework and you get the sense people are taking more serious by avoiding even domestic travel. I find it kinda funny the governor is asking people to not come to Sapporo when it’s the people from Sapporo going to visit their family homes in Inaka places they should be worried about. 
I’m pretty sure this lockdown will get extended to at least till the end of May.",0

For some demented reason, Iowa is reopening 77 of 100 counties where there aren't many cases.

My friend's county had 1 case. Makes sense for them to start reopening... My county had about 30 confirmed cases, and borders 3 counties that are still in lockdown, being the biggest city in the area to start reducing restrictions. Guess what is going to happen to our county here in the next 2 weeks?

I have been having a fairly normal life. Groceries, walking outside but not close to anyone, neighbor kids mows my lawn and I send him money through Venmo. All that is going to be much more dangerous from now on, with the influx of people wanting to shop and eat. 

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Did I mention I have a high risk person in my household?

Everyone I know is still being cautious, despite the ""reopening"". Most of us understand that some people are in such awful financial situations that allowing some businesses to operate is letting each person chose the lesser of ""go hungry and get kicked out of my house"" or ""risk contracting COVID-19"". It's especially bad in my hometown where every other business is either a restaurant or a church. Yes, it is a selfish decision to personally say ""I need to eat, screw getting sick"" - but how can anyone condemn that decision when the government is doing nothing to help feed the poor or protect the underemployed against eviction? Even if it did, those programs are so horribly inefficient that help would come too late.

Either way, Gov Kemp is going to come under fire for not opening up to allow people to provide for themselves, or for opening up too soon and more people getting sick. The true problem is that the media is being really irresponsible by not emphasizing the governor's message to be careful and prudent after loosening lockdown measures.",0

The US is still struggling with most of those things, so opening up for that country is probably not a good idea.

I would argue that a lockdown of that duration would cause a significant increase in crime, suicides, and famine deaths which would practically negate the lockdown to begin with.

That's assuming we ever get out of the first wave. We haven't even begun to level off in terms of overall infection. The linear graph shows a steady climb. Any ""leveling off"" we see is more a result of hitting the limits of testing.

It's to give hospitals time to properly equip with a slow curve in the beginning so when such a time as things are lifted they can properly handle the wave of incoming patients. You hope that the infection slowly trickles out at first so you can handle the rest when it hits. It's a stop gap measure. At best.

This is why I'm so annoyed that the CDC and surgeon general put out statements in March telling people to not get  masks because they're ""ineffective."" They ARE effective and everyone with a shred of sense knows it. They just didn't want people buying up all the PPE, but now that they've flip-flopped and many places are recommending/requiring masks, a lot of people without healthcare knowledge still think masks don't do anything (because THE GOVERNMENT SAID SO FOR WEEKS) and refuse to wear them. I think the US would be in a much better position if everyone wore masks in public as we reopen. Not saying it's perfect, but it would be enough to slow the spread quite a bit and keep that second wave a little more manageable.",0

When we visited there were a few cases in Tokyo and about 2 in Hokkaido, so we felt pretty safe. Facemasks and disinfecting gel where already sold out everywhere and every shop, supermarket, and combini had none left. Luckily we brought our own. Most shops, hotels and other large buildings had a bottle disinfectant were at the door. I never washed my hands so often. From what I could tell the Japanese would either wash their hands for exactly 20 seconds as they are told to do, or not at all. We didn't get sick or notice anything at all during the 2 weeks after our holiday, so either we got of lucky, or we just didn't have any symptoms. Hope Japan gets it under control soon though, I'd still love to go back again soon.",1

The thing is, we all know that will result in a fresh new resurgence of deaths and illness, and it is very difficult to believe that these right-wingers don't also know it.

The most charitable interpretation is that these governors are merely neglectful.

I would not be surprised if a LARGE percentage of people will lock themselves down for a long time regardless of policy or other peoples actions.  Some people will be scared of this for years to come based on the fear already created.  So in general you will just see less activity for the next year or two I would guess.

Secondly, we have been making PPE etc. and streamlining protocols and procedures for our healthcare system so i would hope(big word) we would be better prepared for a second wave, PLUS a large percentage  of people have immunities.

Those are a few reasons why a second wave MAY be less devastating than we think.  Not to mention the entire world is aware of this now so its no longer a suprise.",0

I want them to work out how to support the people better, who are bearing the worst of the costs of this quarantine so that there's less pressure to do so.  I want PPE for everyone, and short turn around testing, so people can make informed decisions and feel safe, if they do have to work.  I want us all to make this work better, so we can continue it for a while.  I'm watching the deaths climb every single day, and wondering how people can think any different.  But at the same time, when will it be long enough?  How do we avoid this?  I don't know if we can.  I think a second wave is inevitable, because we can't stay in lock down until there's a vaccine. Hell even with lock downs (because pretty much everyone was on lock down when the infections that lead to this week's deaths were contracted) the numbers are/were climbing in the US. I'm sure that will accelerate with even just the small number of states who've lifted restrictions.  It seems destined to climb, and the only thing we can influence is the rate of increase.  I see no indication we've been able to reverse the climb.  I just hope our second wave is not as overwhelming as that first wave was going to be, and that people will be willing to do as Hokkaido is doing, because I can't see how that's not going to happen, regardless of how long we wait to come off lock down.",1

&#x200B;

I know people are saying well we can avoid these covid deaths, and maybe we can, maybe we cannot.  We can avoid ALOT of the deaths on the top 10 list by diet alone.  I am all for keeping the hospitals open and under capacity that makes perfect sense but how many hospitals in america are currently overrun?(serious question) I guess there is a severe lack of PPE in some place but some place there is no lack. Long term what are our options, how long can we go on like this before the economic and social impact become worse than the virus?  How long before we get an effective treatment or vaccine?",0

We need to go for heard immunity. We can't go back into hiding everytime someone else gets sick. Every time you go into lockdown cases go down that's good however it's still there under the surface. Coming out of lockdown brings it back to the surface. We seriously need to pull a Sweden and just go for heard immunity.

I've seen some say pooling up to 32 samples is OK, meaning you only need to be able to do 30,000 actual tests per day to test 1 million people per day.

Edit: Here is the research underpinning it. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30362-5/fulltext",1

In the rare case it's positive, you go back and test the samples individually (or test in smaller groups) so you can track down the specific sample (or samples) that were positive.

That's how Germany massively improved capacity overnight.

Edit: Thankyou for the ~~chompy~~ Flatten The Curve Award, honoured.

Edit 2: For those asking, no they don't stick the same swab in 32 throats. They pool some of each sample for the pool and keep more of it for testing later if needed. Here's an [academic paper](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30362-5/fulltext) and a [plain-language article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/coronavirus-group-testing.html) about pooled testing for Covid.

They pull 10 or so folks out of line, put them in a bullpen, and then everyone gets their hands wiped with the same swab.

If the swab comes back negative, everyone goes on their merry way.  If it comes back positive, now everyone gets individual scrutiny.  It massively increases the number of people tested with little incremental cost in time or materials.  One test cycle, 10x the number of people tested.  Compare this to how the TSA tries to do the same kind of random explosives screening.  

**Adding to this because of comments: naturally, you wouldn't share something like a friggin' swab between passengers if you're testing for some sort of infectious agent.  You'd aggregate the individual swabs on some other medium you run the test on.  *sigh*  No, I'm not advocating for a swab that has been in someone else's mouth or nose being put into yours.

This virus is stripping everything bare and showing exactly who the massive institutions that make up each system’s respective societies are fundamentally meant to serve. 

To answer your specific questions, state control of industries allow them to manufacture that many tests, and a well-educated populace and robust scientific sector provide the ability to produce that many tests. 

Why are “we” not doing it? Assuming you live somewhere in the anglosphere or Western Europe, because our institutions are designed to serve people with the most capital. A pandemic requires a rapid response from all levels of society, and there is simply too much privatization to coordinate that on the massive scale needed this quickly. It’s something a lot of countries are working towards, and some are further along than others, but only those with a core of institutional support for all citizens, like China and Vietnam, have been able to succeed thus far.

Do you really need reasons for why a government would want to test its citizens for the deadly virus that is currently ravaging the world?

In a testing protocol proposed by Jonathan Schmid-Burgk at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his team, every sample being tested for SARS-CoV-2 would be tagged with a unique DNA sequence that would serve as a biological barcode. High-speed sequencing instruments common in research laboratories around the world could then be used to analyse as many as 100,000 DNA samples at one time. The authors anticipate that if clinical testing validates the method, then millions of samples could be analysed per day at each sequencing site — a far more efficient output than that of current testing techniques.

Testing 11 million people in China is equivalent to testing 1% of their population. Any competent country should be able to achieve that.

Furthermore, they sent 20,000 medical professionals to Wuhan when the outbreak happened, and also built 2 functional hospitals in one week. They can do this because the central government can allocate resources efficiently, and don't need to worry about provinces (Chinese equivalent of states) competing against each other for resources. They can easily divert a small percentage of test kits from every city, and they'll have enough to test the city. 

In fact, for some actual math. China has 686 cities, so essentially if they take 16k test kits from each city, they'll have enough to test 11 million. 

I think people have been reading too much news regarding how the US has handled the virus, and don't realize the majority of other countries out there aren't nearly as incompetent. Many are conditioned into thinking very simple and logistically probable things are suddenly difficult and impossible.",0

Australias successful lockdown was only possible because of how quickly our job seeker/job keeper payment system was implemented. 

Job seeker is for anybody unemployed who will need to start looking for a new job. In normal times if you get this payment you have to prove you are trying to find employment but they got rid of that requirement for now. I think this is about $800 per fortnight. They increased this payment from normal temporarily also. 

Job keeper is new and its for if you will still have a job after this but you have few/no shifts atm. I believe Job keeper is paid to the employer who then pays it to you. I haven't heard of any employer abusing this. Its up to $1500 per fortnight.

To me they go hand in hand. If you manage the spread by contact tracing and testing and self isolation, then you don't need as many large-scale lockdowns.

Of course, if tests are not available, that's not going to work. Also, although it is a failure at an individual case level, that doesn't mean it is the individual's failure.

What do you mean “out of this by May”? I’m well aware what the hivemind of this sub thinks, but there was never a realistic chance of eradicating the virus in the US. 

The virus was spreading unchecked and unknown through major American cities as early as December 2019 and possibly even November. By the time the first wave of lockdowns started going in around March, there were already massive numbers of infected individuals in most major population centers, the vast majority of them not counted as “cases” due to lack of testing.

Lockdowns slow the spread, but once you open up, the cases come right back. It only takes one case that slips through contact tracing / testing to begin the exponential spread all over again. 

There is no “out of this” until 1) a high-efficacy vaccine is available in large quantities AND taken by most of the population, or 2) enough of the population has been infected and recovered from the virus, such that the rate of spread slows to a manageable level. 

If you are waiting for #1, be aware that it is highly questionable how effective any vaccine will be (50%, 75%, etc.), supplies will be very limited at first, and there may be large numbers of people who simply refuse to take it.",0

Alot of people gave up because of the media and how asymptomatic people were considered contagious. Don't get me wrong they are, but I believe its pretty clear that they aren't the main vector of infection. People start shedding the virus before symptoms, but do often get symptoms and those are what we need to focus on. (contact tracing, etc...)

&#x200B;

Also, in my province here in Canada, the government as essentially every possible symptom as a COVID symptom. This makes it very hard to focus on specifics. I understand that we want to stop the spread of COVID, but I think focusing solely on dry cough and fever, and loss of smell/taste would go a long way...

I think it might have something to do with with the effects in other poorer countries aswell as the negative effects on the lockdown country itself. There are signs that the catastrophy happening there will be far worse than what we are experiencing in richer countries.
This does not mean that lockdowns are all bad but lockdowns are at a scale. It also doesnt mean that all negative secondary effects are because of the lockdowns/closed boarders etc. 

Here are some example of what I mean.

 ""Recent estimates also suggest that up to 6,000 children could die every day from preventable causes over the next six months as a result of pandemic-related disruptions to essential health and nutrition services.""

This report by the UN paints similarly a horrible picture.

“This pandemic has already caused the biggest global education emergency in history, and the increase in poverty will make it very hard for the most vulnerable children and their families to make up for the loss”, said Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children.  

“Children who lose out on education are more likely to be forced into child labour or early marriage and be trapped in a cycle of poverty for years to come. We cannot afford to let a whole generation of children become victims of this pandemic. National governments and the international community must step up to soften the blow.”

Probably because there are very real dangers of lockdowns, and people deserve to know about them.

The fact it gets painted as “people just want to go to bars and get haircuts” is absurd. The fact that some people are arguing that we can’t put a dollar value on human lives is equally absurd. The real costs of the lockdown need to be taken into account, and balanced with actual benefits.",0

First, they don’t eliminate all travel and contact between people, they only reduce contact and transmission. With that in mind, the costs are pretty high. When governments all rushed to issue lockdowns and stay at home orders, the CFR was 3.4% and the IFR was estimated at 1.4%. Testing in most countries was nonexistent. Hospitals were overwhelmed and had no idea how to treat this virus. In these conditions, the risks of lockdowns was worth it. 

We know a lot more about covid now. We’ve driven the IFR down. We’ve done this partially by increasing testing itself because we’re increasing the people we are asking to isolate and/or quarantine. It makes more sense to move to a test, isolate, and trace approach. 

We need this in combination of safety measures like masks and social distancing, as well as restrictions on large gatherings and events of that nature. 

Think of it like sex. Let’s assume we’re trying to prevent pregnancy. Lockdowns are about as effective as abstinence only education. Yeah, staying home and not having any contact is effective, but it’s also not practical. What we need is something as effective as a combination of birth control and condoms. Think of testing/isolating/tracing as birth control and masks/distancing/gathering restrictions as condoms. Those two, working in tandem, can allow us to get by until a vaccine is available. 

Unfortunately, I live in Florida and none of this is happening so I’ll just go around in my mask, give my money to businesses that enforce mask rules, and hope for the best.",0

People see the word ""self"" in the title and assume it's blaming citizens for not being able to quarantine or isolate, but the article *actually* puts the blame where it lies and that's on the government for not being able to provide for citizens who need to isolate/quarantine. Countries like Singapore and South Korea have specific facilities for people to isolate, of course, people don't have to worry about losing their jobs during this time. Even Sweden, everyone's favorite country, has paid leave for people who have symptoms and people who need to quarantine. 

Once cases can easily be traced, those cases have to be withdrawn from the general population until they recover, even mild cases. The alternative is not being able to keep track of these cases and then exponential growth happens, then everyone has to lockdown and everyone gets punished for bureaucratic failure.",1

"" The WHO does not recommend that countries enter lockdowns. It has consistently said that the key to controlling epidemics, whether Covid-19, Sars or flu, is to test people, trace their contacts and ensure all those who are positive or who have been close to those infected are quarantined. ""

 "" 'For me, the big missing link in what’s going on in many European countries is management of isolation,” said Dr Margaret Harris of the WHO. “That’s not just isolation of people who are sick – it’s isolation of people who have contacts and are first-degree contacts. ' ""

The point of the article is that you need testing and effective contact tracing so people know if they are positive, or have come into contact with someone who is positive, or have the symptoms.  Then they need to self-isolate.

The point is not that everyone should self-isolate (that's just an unenforced lockdown).",1

It's a little bit like an engineer designing a product but being confused on people aren't using it the way an engineer would.

Ultimately, different COVID restrictions and their effectiveness matter a lot depending on a person/place's culture, employment situation, economy, age, health, etc. 

Asking orthodox religious people and extremely tight knit groups with large families to cease doing the activities they essentially value in life more than perhaps life itself WILL NOT HAPPEN, and has not happened. It would be like asking tech people to give up their cell phone, internet connection and computer. Good luck with that. 

History is full of many examples of what happens when in demand things are banned. What happens is they go underground. If you ban public gatherings, they go private. When the United States passed prohibition of alcohol, it went underground. The reason restrictions have not and will not work is because it just simply sends the stuff they restrict out of sight and underground. There is essentially nothing they can do about that. 

Governments and health officials had one chance in March/April to get large scale compliance, which they did, and one chance only. They should accept a lot of the blame for this, they got people to stop their lives for 2-3 months in most cases, and they did not do their part of the bargain and prepare for what happens after.

Prohibition mentality is in place, at least in the United States, seems like most of Europe too, and that is life. It is not realistic to assume anything else at this point. People are largely done with complying, will happily do it in public and do the same things they did before under closed doors. This stuff happens all the time in Muslim type countries too - conservative from the outside - much more raucous internally. Welcome to society as we head into 2021. 

So what do you do then? I believe the focus needs to shift on surgically isolating and protecting the most vulnerable. People who are concerned and at risk should have government level support to have what they need. They should be given PPE that will actually protect them from others - not BS cloth masks. Making sure they have what they need to survive. Perhaps subsidize deliveries of essential items. 

There needs to be a point of reckoning in my opinion. All further restrictions will have rapidly diminishing returns and are not going to work. Full stop.",1

But out of naivety and gloom some of us do want to enjoy lives and not be deprived of rare moments of happiness in these sad times.

>In many countries where community transmission has
led to outbreaks with near exponential growth, countries
have introduced widespread population-level physical
distancing measures and movement restrictions in order
to slow spread and set in place other control measures.
Physical distancing measures and movement restrictions,
often referred to as “shut downs” and “lock downs,” can
slow COVID-19 transmission by limiting contact between
people. However, these measures can have a profound
negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies
by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such
measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups,
including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced
people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded
and under resourced settings, and depend on daily
labour for subsistence.

It's my neighbors that don't. One of my neighbors has it. She sent her kids last week, they were immediately sent back because I called the school nurse. No one thought to make sure her husband wasn't working as a crosswalk guard for the sexchool that day. He did and now over half our school is on quarantine over it with 25 confirmed cases to to contact with him. 52 more kids off starting tomorrow after contact with the positive kids. This man also continued to go work in the soup kitchen so I guarantee there is a slew of homeless people with it as well now. He continued to work even up to 3 days after he got sick. I think he ended up fired but him claimed he didn't know he had to be off. 

I keep hearing people say it is just a flu. No, I have had flu and I have had Covid. Two weeks plus after positive result and it still takes everything in me just to stand up out of bed. I have been off work for three weeks and there is no financial help I qualify for right now. I have to go back to work but I don't think i am ready.

South Korea immediately in January allowed the private sector to develop kits too, that was crucial to their success, one Korean company even said they are putting manufacturing as many as they can above profits, but the FDA wouldn't approve their kit. Finally they eventually let private companys kits get tested but by then we were behind.

What do you propose a normal citizen with no medical background do in this situation while locked down in their house due to shelter in place? Because I see 'shining light on the shortcomings of our current administration' as doing something. I see that as adding to the chorus of voices letting this administration know they are fucking up and trying to correct them to a more sane course of action.",0

Ask the 10,000 people who were on this sub in January where we thought this was headed in the coming months and what the USA was in for.

The amount of videos, new, reports, posts from on the ground citizen reporters in China (before they disappeared) was more than enough to show the USA and other countries around the world EXACTLY what we were in for.

We are at the beginning of the worst case scenario discussed in February in many reports and articles that were posted here.

Never forget the USA had all the info they needed in January to see where this was headed - and they chose to do nothing - and there is proof of that from people on the inside who have started talking to reporters. I saw an article a few days ago from who tried to warn the US Gov't what was coming, said they needed to take action now (January) and they refused.

YES. 1,000% YES. What you see today could have been avoided if we took action in January or February. There was more than enough data to support massive action to save lives, jobs, the economy, etc. This is the biggest fuck-up in the history of the USA driven by ego and pumping the stock market and economy.

They gave me a paper saying to stay home for 14 days or until all symptoms are gone.

Fox the GOP and the President are all responsible for each of these deaths and the corresponding economic slowdown. QAnon and tons of his other idiot followers all posted that it was a hoax and videos of licking toilets..  

In a sane world the pandemic response team would have identified the new threat, closed off travel and identified everyone exposed quarantining them. Labs would start breaking it down and identifying existing RNA blockers etc to find quick remedies while developing a long term vaccination strategy. Once the vaccine made it to the public risk levels could be reevaluated. Very few deaths and we don't need to loan the rich $$$. Nature is what we make it we aren't oranges we can think our way through problems.

Do you trust the Chinese government? - NO! So to blame China you have to agree that Trump trusted China.. Or he didn't and decided it was a hoax as told to him by QAnon conspiracy theorists. Or worse yet he knew and was delaying to make a profit.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1AXa9vnydE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1AXa9vnydE)",1

For instance, for the US, or any country, to justify stockpiles of ""just in case"" hardware/food/etc. someone has to make a justification,  a business case if you will, about the cost of the project and maintenance. Of course, any proposal will have opponents that will want those funds to support their cause, and they will bend the most emotional topics to their cause. Not that this is right or wrong, it is simply a level of competition that is very high and takes a toll on society: effort apathy. In other words, the consequence of polarization. 

To me, this article states the obvious and missed the deeper issue of ""when experts knew this would be bad, why did politicians make bad decisions?""

My personal belief is that we, citizens of western modern democracy, have allowed politicians to avoid consequences of lieing for too long. All parties lie. Smart politicians, usually lawyers, know how to ""shave the truth"" and state partial truths that are hard to catch... others seem to be blatant criminals, or at least unindicted co conspirators. But I digress.

Let's not shoot the messengers. Let's try to figure out where our leadership is failing to make better moral and societal decisions. Perhaps they all must spend 6+ years as a junior public leader before being elected.... darn, I did it again.",1

1) Around January 20ish, the Chinese health minister in a press conference said asymptomatic people are infectious, the CDC didn't believe him. The Chinese acted based on that information (enforcing a stricer version of shelter at home for cities outside of the epicenter, Hubei), but CDC didn't (didn't test the incoming US citizens & green card holders still allowed to fly back to the US, didn't have some sort of monitored & enforced self quanrantine etc)
2) Screwed up the initial test kit
3) Told people not to wear masks",1

""that's only if there were significant numbers of cases already in the USA at that time which we don't know  and didn't believe. ""

Lock downs don't help if there is not a carrier. 

Most transmissions came from people breaching the screenings or non symptomatic cases entering.  What stopped most of those were the presidents quick actions to shutdown travel from china and then Europe and his ban on travel from Iran.. All of which the democrats criticized him for. 

But unfortunately some areas like NY openly told people to embrace.. Literally embrace those communities most at risk so it has spread like wild fire there.  

Washington State was because of a bungled handling by CDC of the isolation of the cruise ship passenfers brought back from Japan.  Trump has order their quarantine which was the first ruminant president had taken that extraordinary step with American citizens.  Unfortunately the CDC bungled the quarantine and one caretaker went to a small nearby town to the base and it spread from there.

The CDC has bungled things from day one just like they did the aids crisis in the 1990s which they could have stopped in its tracks by shutting down the gay bars and quarantining the carriers but they refused because of political reasons. 

The CDC is too political.",1

Starting only doing online church. Cancelled attending large gathers with a few expectations. Increase it as things went down hill. Went full shelter mid March. 19 yr old son hasn’t seen his long time girlfriend in weeks. He says he agrees with me. Her family hasn’t been practicing social distancing or anything. House still grand central station. Haven’t seen any extended family for the same reason. It’s a bummer but Oh well.,1

[https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections) is an interactive website Rachael Maddow shared with the world last night. It is compiled by The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. She spoke with Dr. Christopher Murphy.  This map is interactive and shows data not only for the US projections for this virus, but each individual state.  It looks as though Florida will be the hardest hit after New York with close to 8000 deaths.  The peak shows May 3rd for Florida so we will be after Alabama I think and then Florida.  I hope we become very good friends with Cuomo who has suggested other states may need ventilators he has and might share.  In fact, why can’t we send some of ours there now because they are peaking in two weeks and we will be peaking in a month?  This does make sense.  She also had on her show someone who spoke of Global Supply Chain Management.  This is so what we need, someone to allocate resources where needed.  I hope that someone will review this data and warn Floridians about this trend as well as work with the media in other states to see how to implement help to Alabama, Florida, and Georgia as well as others.  There must be a way and am hopeful.  In Florida we must gear up as New York did weeks before this hit finding, contracting, begging for beds, health care workers, PPE, masks, ventilators, and most of all MASH hospitals.  We have only a few days to obtain ICU beds that are needed.  I am just a concerned citizen of no real consequence.  Just very, very worried.",1

WHO was wrong.  Stop blaming politicians.  See link for speech given on March 3, 2020 for Christ sakes.

&#x200B;

""First, COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza, from the data we have so far.

With influenza, people who are infected but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission, which does not appear to be the case for COVID-19.""

&#x200B;

This is what they were saying on March 3?? That's less than a month ago.  So are politicians now expected to be doctors?  If the WHO was not recommending it, why would they have taken these steps... Many, many errors made by WHO",1

Places such as Hong Kong and Korea that got it under control (despite being far closer and having far more Chinese travel) did not ban travel from China.

Instead, they quarantined and tested heavily anyone coming in.

I know U.S. citizens who flew back from China, including with a family member who *actually had a fever* (but it was from just getting a vaccine), but there were no temperature checks, no questionnaires, nothing, not even a request to self-quarantine (though he and his family self-quarantined themselves, knowing how bad it was in China).

It's like a weird delusion that just by virtue of being an American, you couldn't catch it.

The problem with the travel ban is that it was just an ineffectual ""Did that, Mission Accomplished"" move, that left the country blind to community transmission and cases coming in from elsewhere. The countries with the most cases today?

Italy and the U.S.

We have to get ahead of trumps efforts to spin the narrative. Straight up say “using your model what was the estimated deaths if we started country wide social distancing when we first knew about corona in Washington. How about if we even did it a week and half ago?”.

Trump is going to say his efforts made the death count go from 2 million to 100,000. Just implying that 100,000 was always best case scenario",1

**The first time Trump admitted the coronavirus might be a problem was Mar 13th. Below are Trump Quotes from Jan 22nd to March 17th.**

    Note that on February 20th the Stock Market Crashed.


**January 22:** “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

**February 2:** “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

**February 24:** “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

**February 25:** “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

**February 25:** “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

**February 26:** “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

**February 26:** “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

**February 27:** “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

**February 28:** “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

**February 28:** “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa.” “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.”

A lot of people in Los Angeles and around the US are not taking lockdown seriously anymore. I'd say mostly because of misinformation from right-leaning sources but also from lockdown fatigue.

This is not really how the math works.  It's really complicated to explain just over a comment.

Without this mutation, you can STILL have triple the number of infections due to a number of factors including:

- higher density of infections as we go up the sigmoid curve: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function

- the propensity for people to spend more time indoors

- the increase of runny noses during the winter and people leaving covid on doorknobs , etc.

This is a 70% increase in infectivity which puts the replication coefficient (which we use to model growth and distribution) at about 5.1... that's really really bad.

ALL of the factors hitting at once is REALLY REALLY REALY REALLY bad.",0

It’s just that new covid infections *of this particular strain* tripled over the time period.

With made up numbers to illustrate how this could happen even without changing the overall rate:

Imagine 100 people a day are getting covid.  30 with the new strain, 70 with the old.

The new strain could triple in its transmission and go from 30 to 90, but the old strain could drop out and go from 70 to 10.  With a total still of 100 despite a new strain tripling.

 Now in reality to increased infectiousness of the new strain means the overall rate presumably goes up some over what it otherwise would have been, but it doesn’t have to triple.  The new strain is out competing the old one which will eventually fade out.

Same thing happened in the US with the first areas in the west coast getting an earlier strain and NYC getting a more transmissible European strain.  That strain quickly became predominant all over the US, including places like Washington state, which has been overwhelmingly the other strain.",0

The tier system in the uk was adopted specifically so that our politicians could avoid calling it a lockdown. In people's minds, we're in some sort of grey area, and we're acting with the freedom that we had in the summer.

Everything our government says, run by a man who's only other job was saying as much as possible without saying anything of actual substance, is muddled, unclear, and grey. The people need black and white, concise, clear and to the point - unfortunately as 2020 proved, people in large groups tend towards the weakest intellectual link. 

This is only made worse by the fact that the upper echelons of the conservative party have repeatedly made it clear that they are in favour of the do nothing and 'take it on the chin' approach that boris espoused in March. Any lockdown is basically a PR stunt, and as the country don't want to be in another official lockdown, they're not going to do one.

NHS it's a joke - even though the Brits think that they have the best NHS of the world - but it's night and day if we look at most other countries in the EU about doctor competences and NHS organization and seriousness.

In my company, nobody wears a mask inside and this is shameful. The only few wearing masks are the non-Brits. I don't know what's wrong with them and how they can still be so indifferent to this pandemic, to the gov guidelines and, most important, to theirs and others health. It's obviously in their culture not taking care of health. 

Finally, Police is not existent, rarely I saw them doing checks or taking actions when meeting groups of people and nobody wearing a mask - well even officers usually don't even wear masks too. Ridiculous.

FTFY. 

The newer strains do not transmit in another new unknown way although they are more infectious as new hosts are unable to fight them as much for some reason, as in the initial strains many months ago, and are therefore spreading the virus on. Infections are only occurring because people are getting too close, for too long a period of time, are not provided sufficient protection coverage to either stop spraying or being sprayed on, and not effectively washing themselves or their surroundings and somehow getting the virus in their bodies.",1

NOT TO SCARE? If people need anything right now is to get scared and understand the risks we are facing and follow the guidelines that a Public Health system SHOULD give.

Transmission is mainly through spit from an infected person getting into your nose or mouth (and maybe eyes, which is usually a concern for flu but I guess not coronavirus as much). Unless people are often sneezing directly into your mouth, the mask isn't doing much. Usually it's your hands delivering the virus into you, by touching your face after touching a surface with the spit/fluid.

*However*, the mask is *very good* at preventing an infected person from infecting others. Because the mask will stop the spit from getting out when they cough/sneeze.

Given that there are clearly a LOT of infected people in Italy, many of whom don't yet or never will realize they were infected or even ""sick"" at all, random people wearing masks would be useful in such a situation at lowering the rate of spread.

Doctors deal way more with people who are sick, getting right into their faces and inside their bodies and possibly spread non-coronavirus diseases too if they're not careful. So they need the masks way more, even at the early stages and even if they aren't infected with coronavirus.

It's complicated to explain all this to people without them getting seriously confused. So the authorities typically only give you the most relevant piece of info: ""please don't buy all the masks"".

There's also different types of masks which are more or less effective at all this, which complicates the messaging. And one big issue is there aren't enough masks, and doctors need to still be able to get them for their critical roles.",0

No entertainment centers are allowed to open, so you probably have no reason to stay outside your home. Wherever you go, you get temperature taken and mask check. When you come back, hand in the card, say your room number and temperature taken, some communities have sanitizer and disinfect your shoes. If you have a high temperature, you are brought to the fever sector in some designated hospitals which only deals with the Covid-19. You get PCR and CT, seating there and keeping a proper distance with other people to provent contagious. If it show negative, you will be sent home. If sadly positive, you are sent to an isolated room for further hospitalize and all your contacts will be traced, tested and isolated in their own house for 14 days(hospital if positive). In China all the confirmed cases are in hospitals, we don’t want any dangerous factor near normal citizens.

In Hubei Provence is different. People are only allowed to go out once everyone two days to buy foods and daily usage, if you have some problems, you can call the community volunteers to help, but only basic life needs can be fullfilled. Everyday everyone needs to open the Wechat APP and upload their health situation. At the beginning of the lockdown in Wuhan, the equipments and medical staffs are lacking, the tests cannot be delivered to every people. After the reinforcement from all over the country gathered in Hubei, the plague has been successfully contained.

Some redditor here don’t trust the number from China, it might have some little error, but obviously not fake numbers. The NHC posted every confirmed cases about where they go before confirmed to notice normal people to check whether they have possible contact with them. And the curve pretty match between Italy and Wuhan. 

There are some problems in the policy running but its inevitable, conflicts happened when people scared of being contagious, but they already risk the public health. I think living right is the most important one in human rights, to face an unknown disaster, we need to help each other. You can’t enjoy the feeling of freedom when you risk other people, it’s kinda selfish.About the whistle-blower, the whole society feels really sorry and sad, we want to improve the transparency and try not to let this kind of heartbreaking things happen again.

My hometown is Tianjin, I’m Now working in Guangzhou and I have my undergraduate in Wuhan. Wish we can get this through soon!",1

You say numbers reported by China were real yet when there were only 1000-2000 confirmed cases, Wuhan, a city of 11 million or more, had full hospitals already.

It's also on camera/video that when Xi came to visit Wuhan, many quarantined individuals were seen and heard yelling out their window ""its all fake, all lies"" and things of the sort. Many sources claim that deaths in apartments were not reported, which points to ones who had it and healed also being drastically underreported.

Thanks for sharing. Hope Xi pays you and other good footsoldiers your 五毛.

What we need in the world are strong authoritarian systems and a stronger border control to keep an outbreak in check, this way a country can successfully request support from bordering countries without spreading the disease.   
  
Look at NK, Singapore. Almost no cases. And capitalist South Korea's authoritarian surveillance is doing wonders for them. It's not the economic system, it's the government control that matters.  Freedom doesn't work in a crisis situation. What worked in Wuhan? Borderline martial law.  
  
Every country that succeeded in stopping or containing corona has used highly authoritarian, controversial methods, even the seemingly free SK.   
   
Freedom is nice, until a virus or a natural disaster happens, then all of a sudden everyone wants the government to take over, the government to distribute resources, enact quarantine laws, pass UBI, restrict air traffic all while sustaining the economy. Everything suddenly becomes centrally planned.

## The vice president of the Chinese Red Cross, who defeated the virus in Wuhan, at Palazzo Lombardia with President Fontana: ""Too many people around without masks, economic activities must be closed and everyone must stay at home""

In Lombardy ""in the region most affected"" by Coronavirus ""unfortunately the policies are not yet as tight as according to our standards. People don't wear masks, there are still too many people around, public transport is still active and you eat too much in restaurants and hotels ». The vice president of the Chinese Red Cross, Sun Shuopeng, said this on Thursday morning during his speech during the [press point at Palazzo Lombardia with the president of the region, Attilio Fontana](https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_19/coronavirus-lombardia-fontana-oggi-chiedero-governo-misure-piu-rigide-2c06503e-69df-11ea-a8a1-df48c20e9d2e.shtml) .

## «Life is the most important topic»

""It is time - added Vice-President Shuopeng - to close economic activities and prohibit the movement of people. We must hurry, we must stop all economic activities and stop mobility. Everyone must stay at home, in quarantine, and we need everyone to be prepared to protect their lives, because people's lives are the most important thing, we don't have a second choice in front of life ». “Everyone is involved in the fight against Covid-19, not just the government, not just the medical staff. All citizens must be involved and follow containment measures, ""he added.

## «Situation similar to Wuhan»

""With the control and quarantine measures it is easier to identify the people infected by Covid-19 and this can give us indications on the infected people and how to treat them,"" added Shuopeng. ""What you are experiencing now is very similar to what we have experienced in Wuhan, the epicenter of Covid-19, with a very high number of cases of infected people, hospitalized patients and deceased,"" he explained. The very high numbers ""could be a positive thing right now, because we are moving towards the adoption of international practices in the control of infectious diseases"". ""If quarantine measures are increased - he added - it is easier to find exposed people who can have better treatment"".

## Check resumed one month after the lockdown

In Wuhan, he continued, ""it was a month after the complete *lockdown* in the city that hospitals were able to truly start treating patients, reduce the number of patients and overcome the peak of the infection.""",1

European countries are not doing enough either. Looking at the examples of China and South Korea vs Italy and now Spain, France, Germany it is obvious that a complete lockdown is the only way to do it.

You need to get it below one for the number of infections to start decreasing.

This is the reason why draconian measures are called for to control runaway pandemics!

There's barely enough - if that - for healthcare workers + those directly instructed by doctors to wear them (ie, those who are sick but don't have major symptoms, or who might be sick but we can't afford to test right now).

Those are the people who most need them, and for whom the masks do the most. To recommend everyone wearing a mask would be ideal, if we had the supply - since we don't, if it were recommended we'd immediately completely run out and those who benefit society most by having them would run out far earlier.

Considering that droplet transmission viruses (like the one causing COVID19) often require larger droplets than that, these masks could be even more effective against this particular virus.

Yes the mask is useless against protecting YOURSELF against the virus, however it is useful to protect OTHERS against the virus if the person using it is not feeling well.

Here in Asia most people wear the face mask (look at Hong Kong and Taiwan) even if they are feeling well.

All of the available data shows that masks (even home-made cloth masks) not only reduce your chance of infecting others, but also protect healthy people from infection.  However, even if you ignore the following studies, we now know that asymtomatic transmission is a major driver of new infections ([source](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html)) and therefore the CDC and WHO should be recommending that everyone wear a mask (home-made if necessary) to reduce new infections.

---

[National Institutes of Health](http://archive.is/5Vm12) - Home-made cloth masks reduce permeation even of tiny 0.02 µm–1 µm particles by 50%, with surgical masks reducing permeation by 75% even during real-world activities.  Considering that droplet transmission viruses (like the one causing COVID19) often require larger droplets than that, these masks could be even more effective against this particular virus.

Quote:
> Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.

---

[International Journal of Infectious Diseases](http://archive.is/1Mwcb) - This one shows surgical masks preventing the wearer from being infected when living with someone who has the flu.

Quote:
> We found compliance to be low, but compliance is affected by perception of risk. In a pandemic, we would expect compliance to improve. In compliant users, masks were highly efficacious.

---

[Journal of the American Medical Association](http://archive.is/cvUQ7) - This study of 446 nurses in Ontario hospitals showed that n95 masks and surgical masks offered similar protection from viral infection for the wearer.

Quote:
> Our data show that the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was similar in nurses wearing the surgical mask and those wearing the N95 respirator. Surgical masks had an estimated efficacy within 1% of N95 respirators.

---

[National Institutes of Health](http://archive.is/GMOaG) - Surgical masks offer almost as effective filtration efficiency against simulated particles as n95 masks.

Quote:
> The in-vivo filtration tests illustrated that N95 respirators filtered out 97% of potassium chloride (KCl) solution, while surgical masks filtered out 95% of KCl solution.

---

And for the coup de grâce, here's one published in [Emerging Infectious Diseases](http://archive.is/spCh6) (the journal of the CDC) with a juicy quote:

> We present the results of a prospective clinical trial of face mask use conducted in response to an urgent need to clarify the clinical benefit of using masks. The key findings are that <50% of participants were adherent with mask use and that the intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference between arms. Although our study suggests that community use of face masks is unlikely to be an effective control policy for seasonal respiratory diseases, **adherent mask users had a significant reduction in the risk for clinical infection**. Another recent study that examined the use of surgical masks and handwashing for the prevention of influenza transmission also found no significant difference between the intervention arms (12).

> Our study found that only 21% of household contacts in the face mask arms reported wearing the mask often or always during the follow-up period. Adherence with treatments and preventive measures is well known to vary depending on perception of risk (27) and would be expected to increase during an influenza pandemic. During the height of the SARS epidemic of April and May 2003 in Hong Kong, adherence to infection control measures was high; 76% of the population wore a face mask, 65% washed their hands after relevant contact, and 78% covered their mouths when sneezing or coughing (28). In addition, adherence may vary depending on cultural context; Asian cultures are more accepting of mask use (29). Therefore, although we found that distributing masks during seasonal winter influenza outbreaks is an ineffective control measure characterized by low adherence, **results indicate the potential efficacy of masks in contexts where a larger adherence may be expected, such as during a severe influenza pandemic or other emerging infection.**",0

We should take social distancing very seriously. And all play our part. But a total 100% lockdown, to then get rid of the virus is not achievable.

IF the whole world would go into lockdown, only one person does not have to comply, only one, and the whole thing starts over again as soon as the lockdown is lifted. The only way to overcome this without going into lockdown for years is to slowly let the virus run its course. Get some herd immunity, without overheating the health system.

china did well enough once they took it seriously..

we're ( morocco ) going to a full lockdown in a couple of hours, most people understand  to goverment isn't fucking around.

they're also moving some military vehicles around to signal how serious this is.

we're still around 74 confirmed cases and 2 deaths btw, from 349 tests.

In fact I think all the governments and social structures across the world are too complex to be simply categorised by one simple word of these idealogies.

&#x200B;

1. Autoritarian socities should still push for more information transparency, the lack of info does not make the government look less stupid and only encourages further uncontrolled rumours.  (The initial suppression by the Wuhan government costs 4-6 valuable weeks) Singapore is a good example.
2. Modern life should abolish some of the so-called traditions if they are deemed a risk, such as the popular wet markets across south east asia. Singapore, Hk used to have them too but got rid of them from their experience with epidemics during the 20th century. Authoritarian societies can make these legal and regulation changes even faster, the reluctancy to do so is due to cultural and even capitalistic reasons. (Yeah, well, China is like a mixed monster of captalism and socialism these years.)
3. Captalism governments should still assert theirpositive influence on the society actively by nationalising important infrastructures, and a public health insurance is important. Many Western European countries did this very well, some North European countries did this well enough that they look more like Communism countries than China does in terms of social welfare.
4. Social orders and rules should be adaptive to crisis, war-time responses of the government is an example. You need community-level propoganda to educate the mass population on what to do (Australian government does so during summer fire periods), and use military to help with social order.  If you do not actively educate the people you cannot really blame all those people partying at the beaches. If the military cannot protect the citizens during a time of crisis they lose their total purpose of existence.",0

I'm sorry to tell you that is not even a lock-down, they are slowly lifting off the lock-down.  The Western style lock-down stage 1 (only allow working, buying foods etc) will probably be the norm for many major cities in the coming months.

Lock-downs in Hubei is much more strict, strict to the point a lot of my Western friends here in Australia could not comprehend it and believe in stupid rumours.

Try to track the number of deaths, not necessarily the infection numbers. The Chinese numbers were published with a side note that the numbers represent those who are being admitted and treated by the medical system. Beyond a certain threshold, like in Italy and Wuhan, the numbers are capped by the system's ability to treat patients. This will likely happen everywhere else as well.

Restaurants, bars, all meeting places have been shut down for the last 7 days.

Public transport is still active, because you have to bring people to their workplaces somehow.

One aspect that isn't being discussed is that China is not equal to most of the rest of the world. They can afford shutting down an entire city, knowing well that the rest of the country does have a surplus production capacity that can cope at least with the basic internal demand. And like other Asian countries who learned their lessons from SARS and other outbreaks, they already have some experience handling outbreaks, unlike many other countries in the world.

What I would like to know is: how exactly did they provide for the needs of the communities in lockdown? I mean basic needs such as food and healthcare.",1

As for masks: Italy has some internal production, I suppose, but very few people had any mask already in stock for the simple reason that, unlike Asia, we never went through a SARS or any other outbreak. It stands to reason people in the Asian countries were probably already aware of the advantage of stocking masks.

Per fortuna che lo stanno capendo, grazie Cina & Co, che lo hanno dovuto spiegare.

Tristezza vera ma in queste situazioni, soprattutto in Italia dove e' scarso il rispetto delle regole o delle leggi,  ci vuole il rigore totale imposto dalle autorita' . Se cosi' fosse stato dall'inizio di questa tragedia avremmo certamente evitato l'esplosione dell'epidemia.

Comunque speriamo adesso che il buon senso prevalga accompagnato da una rinascita di un minimo di patriottismo, genuino e salutare.

There is a major difference between them

Masks work differently than you would think. It's not very good at prevent you from catching the virus, that's true; but it works very well to prevent you from spreading the disease to others.

But most people are like this: I feel totally fine, so I don't need wear those stuff. That's where you get it TOTALLY WRONG. This virus can spread from people who are infected, but not showing symptoms. This fact means every people around you, include yourself, is a danger to others, it doesn't matter how you feel.

That's why people need to wear masks to fight this particular virus, it's not A FLU, and don't treat it like one. This method won't work unless everyone wears it.

Another problem people might think is: But this will creat shortage at hospitals! We must leave stuff to them! But the fact is, Medical staff need top-grade n-95 masks,  those are rare and hard to produce, and undoubtedly we must leave n-95 masks to doctors and nurses. Ordinary people only need surgical masks, or even make-shift masks from clothes, those are very easy to make.",0

It’s ridiculous that people think this is OK without considering other factors such as social pressure. If you only wear the mask when you are sick, you will choose not to even if you feel sick. Since doing so will tell other people that you are sick, and you don’t want to feel that social pressure. And imagine if one person doing so, and all the others are not wearing masks, this will only make the virus spread more rapidly.",0

There have been arguments that Coronavirus has mutated to become more of an aerosol than a droplet infection.

What do you think about the Diamond Princess example, where passengers were seemingly infected through the ventilation ducts? Princess Cruises claims that they have filters which would have prevented that sort of spread.

I think the issue is people feeling a false sense of security in going to a friends house, or family members home. Our roommate had three friends over to hang out a few nights ago. He thinks it's ok because ""they are all social distancing."" 

Um, no, you aren't social distancing if you see your friends once a week and they all see their friends once a week.

It’s been both men and women, but I definitely see more young men. A few times I’ve seen people passing a blunt around. No masks obviously.

And yet we wonder why there’s a significant amount of of older people getting sick without going out into the community or having any known sick contact exposure, when we know full well that families in the predominately lower socioeconomic community of Central Brooklyn dwell together. These young people are picking up the virus and spreading it to their parents and grandparents with whom they live in close quarters.

It was specifically interested in the impact of COVID-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK, which is why no mention of the elderly is included in this report. 

The [figure on page 14](https://imgur.com/p9E6TUT) also suggests that females self-report more trauma and anxiety, though both sexes are experiencing an increase in anxiety and trauma. It's also noteworthy that for some reason the age group with the highest reports of trauma and anxiety across sexes is the 19-21 age group. 

I think people's [risk assessment](https://imgur.com/uEKYdQY) was also interesting. While the young people generally feel less at risk than older people, a disturbing amount of people think there is no risk of them catching the virus or transmitting the virus. Males 18-24 were more likely to think they had no risk of catching or spreading, but they were also more likely to think they had a health condition which put them more at risk of having more serious symptoms.

An important consideration we should do with any data on sex differences is the possibility that the underlying populations studied have different distributions. If 18-24 year old males on average assessed their risk as both lower and higher it might be useful in looking into that group for more information. That one group is diverging from the rest for multiple measures: they leave the house more for [food/health/work](https://imgur.com/8v6uhNH), they are more likely to [exercise multiple times a day](https://imgur.com/L9DJSut), and leave the house to [care for elderly](https://imgur.com/yUq4lhU). Sadly they are also the least likely to[ wash their hands](https://imgur.com/Cmf5GTv) when they go home, or [wash more often than usual](https://imgur.com/x262bvX).",1

Girls do what they are told and they are docile because they usually have less testosterone. They more easily refer to authorities because they somehow think authorities know what they are doing despite OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE that said authorities are completely incompetent.

Men? Why the hell would I do something another man is telling me to do if it has no logical basis in reality?

Sure if you tell me to not jump into a pool infested with sharks I will definitely listen to you both because I can safely guess that the sharks will kill me and because I never intended on jumping in there on the first place.

But if you tell me not to visit friends or family because some vague scare about the common flu and now this one flu is from the bats and it is nasty and shit why the hell would I listen to you?

Please make your case and logically explain to me how covid19 is actually dangerous.

Sorry but the medias freaking out and having authorities behind them overhyping a cold for 2 months is not enough to convince me. I need facts, logics and an actual reason.

Of course you can always find some ignoramus to cry ""vaccines don't stop infection at all"" - but in spite of it clearly not working very well, further attempts at education are the plan for now. Mandates and other unpleasant methods are slowly gaining ground, but the idealist in my wishes that wouldn't be needed.

I actually think California has the best approach and a lot of that has to do with setting policies based on hospitalization instead of case count. The issue is case counts are no longer an accurate representation because we really don't care about people contracting covid and being asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms. That shows vaccines are working and doing what it's suppose to. It's an expected probability that everyone at one point will contract covid since it's a statistical improbability to attain covid 0. 

Lockdowns make sense if they are to dampen the load on the health care system. You don't want hospitals to be out of ventilators, out of beds, etc. The problem is using a lockdown to as a solution to end covid. The solution is to encourage vaccinations and wear mask, and smarter social gathering. 

Case counts only matter if those breakthrough cases are sending vaccinated individuals to the hospital and overtaxing the health care system. I'm using California as an example, there's some that have already acknowledged that those who are willing to get vaccinated will get vaccinated or have already gotten vaccinated, and those that are not, will not and that responses to mask and social distancing policies will be made based on hospitalization. 

As medications and vaccines become more readily available, and the more we learn about COVID, the more likely policies will loosen up as we learn to live with it. 

There are a lot of people that won't agree on what's the right policy, but vaccines work, social distancing works, and mask works. There's no right policies so long as the healthcare system is not overburdened.",0

It seems like the booster does just that, which makes these lockdowns extra weird. It gives counter incentives to people to boost themselves.

Just tell non boosted people that they cannot fully participate in society *until* they get the booster. I.e. try to bolster your boosted statistics. If a mere 30% of the population is not boosted it's possible that we'd get full hospitals forever and by treating all people the same, you make sure that a big part of the population would simply refuse to go along.

 I know (for example ) that that Peterson guy has a lot of followers and/or people who think like him, he refuses to get boosted last I check and even more (of that side of the political spectrum) would do so if you enforce lockdowns.

Covid, as contagious as it is, especially with omicron, is never going away not even with 100% vaccination and a complete lockdown. Actually its not even going to go away if you killed every person on the planet. 

The question is, how far do we go un our attempt to stop this and it still be okay? How far and how frequent until people stop caring. 

Well i can assure you its getting there, especially in America.

- they completely pretended COVID measures didn’t exist since august until November, no mask, no distancing, almost everything open. 
- consequently, they got to ravaged by delta to have a positivity rate of 20 percent, and hospitals full.
- there is no serious quarantine measures, if you’re positive and you have close contacts they might not even need to quarantine just because;
- so many people got positive and had COVID BEFORE omicron that the government announced that people could use home test instead of PCR test in most situations;
- the day they announced that the situation was almost a “code black” (meaning doctors had to choose who lived and who died) then omicron came by.
- they Approved the boosters just in November. At the present time, they’re not available to almost anyone. 
- university were in person, and till LAST WEEK they did not mandate mask while sitting in classroom, neither self testing. 
- large majority of people received J&J vaccine.

With no lockdowns, 102 deaths per million means this disease isn’t as serious as once feared.

In contrast, the US has 8600 deaths per million on an annual basis from all causes. 

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm

Granted COVID has been spreading in Sweden for only about 90 days, so you can assume that the annual death toll with go up by at least 4x times. This would be 400 deaths per million.

It’s possible that there will be exponential growth, but given that new serious cases have remained steady or dropped in the last 10 since peaking.

https://g.co/kgs/VYHrie

It’s very likely there are already hundreds of times more undiagnosed cases out there that are sick but mild, very mild or totally asymptomatic:

But if Sweden’s health care system does overload meaningfully, then the restrictions they do have, even as minimal as they are, are still too relaxed. The CFR rises steeply once there are no more beds or ventilators.

The R0, if it is as high as they say it is (5.7), will be what really drives the deaths during this outbreak. It could result in >10x more deaths than the seasonal flu’s, even if IFR ends up being <0.5%.",0

One conclusion is certainly that Sweden is causing excess death. 

Yeah, I'm not exactly trusting FHM in this. But as far as I know our hospitals, while strained, are not exceeding any limits yet. There are not bodies piling up in the courtyards. Nobody is going to the emergency room without a hospital bed yet as far as I know.

Which means that we are flattening the curve according to our capabilities so far. A steeper curve should not be as long.

It seems logical to me that the death rate only has meaning when it is the final version since this is an ongoing procedure. But people seem to be very upset with us because of it.

The goal is to flatten the curve and the most effective way of doing that is to make sure ppl are minimising their social contacts.

The goal right now is to reach herd immunity as soon as possible without overcrowding the hospital's and putting the weak and elderly at risk. So far our medical systems has on the whole been able to cope quite well. The faster we can reach herd immunity and open up the country again the better.

Living in Norway anything the Swedes do is wrong and were right. Tegnell is taking on lots from numerous angles and after its all said and done I firmly believe Sweden chose the correct path for themselves. What works for Sweden might work in other small nations but UK or US no way. Scandinavians listen and respect their leaders while other nations are somewhat skeptical for good reasons.
If you look at the death rate in Sweden it's mostly 60 and up with a few under. Norway and Sweden classify deaths different from one another so it's not entirely crazy to suggest Norway could have 20-50% more covid deaths if they labeled them as Sweden does (this was in the papers yesterday).
Homogeneous populations imo have a distinct advantage battling Covid 19. The 1 tribe mentality is strong in Scandinavia as well Czech, Slovenia and Slovakia. Norway is much smaller then Sweden and when all is over Sweden might of just peaked early where Denmark and Norway deaths will be spread out over time. Final numbers come down to the transparency in cause of death.",1

Different governments/cultures/people require different solutions. This problem doesn’t have one strategy to rule them all.

I also believe Sweden has chosen the right path, at least when you take the wider view and look at long term strategy and the economy. We need a lot of people to get sick, every country needs to (unless waiting for a vaccine while in strict quarantine for months or years sounds like a good idea). But it has to happen at a reasonable pace, where it doesn’t screw the medical system but also isn’t in the way for the economy. You also need to protect the vulnerable very well, and that we have failed in some ways (homes for the elderly getting many cases). People can’t be locked in forever without social disruption and other health consequences, and once a long quarantine is over, you risk getting a shock with huge groups getting sick quickly. The economy risks tanking if you have to lock people in more than necessary (look at France, four more weeks of strict quarantine).

Also, to give some context to the death rates, Sweden has a high share of people with immigrant background. Lots of the deaths we’re seeing are - like in many other places - from poorer areas, especially with lots of immigrants. They live tighter, across generations (similar to southern Europe) and the authorities struggle to reach them, both with actual information because of language and other barriers but also they lack that culture bit about understanding what the authorities actually want you to do. Without hard restrictions lots risks going wrong with these groups, and Sweden’s poor integration of immigrants shows itself yet again.",0

 \- Some countries report only hospital deaths. Sweden's 1000+ (1200 after easter) are incuding non-hospital deaths. When comparing death rates, one should consider which category.   
Part of the reason Sweden has a large outbreak is because the largest region (Stockholm) had a school holiday that timed exactly with the outbreak in northern italy, and a huge amount of people happened to return to Stockholm infected, without knowing it. Other parts of the country that had their holiday at a different week, have fared better. Perhaps subnational outbreaks should be compared instead of national. 

\- Weekly deaths in Sweden for the past weeks look roughly the same as for the same weeks 2019. It's unclear why the Covid deaths don't show up as a large excess mortality, but one reason could be that other seasonal diseases have been suppressed (e.g. noro/calicivirus is suppressed for the season many weeks before it's normally gone). In any case, this is a sign that the mitigations are in fact working ""ok"" at least.  
\- Sweden doesn't have a lockdown in law, but there is a significant amount of distancing, reduction in travel and contact/reduction. It's not business as usual. In most countries a ""recommendation to do X"" would be a pretty weak instrument. Not in Sweden. E.g. the measles vaccination rate is 97% despite there being no requirement. It's a ""recommendation"".

\- It's easy to compare with Sweden's Nordic neighbors because they appear similar, but outbreaks are in different phases too. Sweden set a goal to protect the elderly and unfortunately that has failed. What that has meant is a large number of dead, compared to cases, hospitalizations and ICU usage.  It's not yet clear what will happen in the long run in Norway and Denmark  but I'm not worried that Sweden does the wrong thing \*yet\*. There are other countries like Belgium and the Netherlands that are also quite similar to Sweden, but people don't seem to compare those. We may still be in for a lockdown if things turn the wrong way, but it doesn't look like it now. 

\- The goal with any mitigations is to ensure hospitals manage. There is also a thought that any mitigations that are sustainable is better than having on-again-off-again total lockdowns. Cases and deaths aren't growing rapidly. They are more or less flat. There was a large temporary hospital constructed to manage a rapid growth in cases - and it was finished a few weeks ago but that surge never came. It's still unused.",1

**But what the figures do not tell us is to what extent the virus is causing the death.**

It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they are dying of something else.

Most people who die with coronavirus have an underlying health condition, such as heart disease or diabetes, that may be more of a factor.

...

Imperial College London modelling, used to inform government, has **suggested 500,000 could have died by August** in the UK if the virus was left to rip through the population.

It also warned the government's previous strategy to slow the spread by asking those with symptoms to self-isolate and shield the most vulnerable could have led to 250,000 deaths.

**Now, it is hoped the lockdown will limit deaths to around 20,000.**

**But that does not mean 480,000 lives are being saved - many will die whether or not they get the virus.**

Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. And the frail and elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus.

Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, at the University of Cambridge, points out, and **the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same.**

That does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be ""a substantial overlap"".

**""Many people who die of Covid \[the disease caused by coronavirus\] would have died anyway within a short period,"" he says.**

...

How many extra deaths are being caused?

**The most recent data goes up to the start of April and shows in the week ending 3 April there were 6,000 deaths above what would be expected** \- this includes deaths in the community as well, so not just hospital deaths as is the case for England and Northern Ireland in the government's daily figures.

**Interestingly, just over half of these were linked to coronavirus.**

**It is unclear what had caused the rest of the increase.**

&#x200B;

**So the lockdown itself could be costing lives?**

**Yes.** Prof Robert Dinwall, from Nottingham Trent University, says it is important that ""the collateral damage to society and the economy"" is closely monitored.

He says this can include:

\- mental health problems and suicides linked to self-isolation

\- heart problems from lack of activity

\- the impact on health from increased unemployment and reduced living standards

\- Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening.

Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, **University of Bristol researchers say the benefit of a long-term lockdown in reducing premature deaths could be outweighed by the lost life expectancy from a prolonged economic dip.**

And the tipping point, they say, is a 6.4% decline in the size of the economy - on a par with what happened following the 2008 financial crash.

It would see a loss of three months of life on average across the population because of factors from declining living standards to poorer health care.""

Governments are going to need to come out and lose face and apologise for the lockdowns. We're killing people with these lockdowns, furthermore it could cause more deaths from the virus by delaying herd immunity, there's no correlation between lockdown and deaths, hospitals are empty and people aren't getting the treatment they need after being needlessly discharged, people aren't getting lumps checked out, and furthermore there is no treatment for the virus so it makes little difference whether there is space in hospitals.

As the fog is clearing we're beginning to see that the Doomers have blood on their hands.

The U.K was one of the few countries with a sensible approach, but the media whipped up hysterical window lickers and turned the issue into political football, and now they have blood on their hands.",1

We have arrived to the point where people are losing their rights because they dont want to consent to a certian form of a medical procedure. The only harsher measure that exists is a state mandated vaccination without the consent of individuals. Getting vaccinated is a personal choice! Or at least it should have been. 

Why take away the most basic rights? Like people are some children that understand only ""do this, or else the punishment will come"". Do the executive and legislative branches of goverment think the people enjoy this crisis? Repression, repression and more and more repression. 

The average age of people who die because of coronavirus is higher than the average life expectancy in several EU countries! And saying that young people die too is entirely correct but young people also die from all kinds of other diseases or accidents that are preventable, but for example, state will not mandate a obligatory alcohol test before driving a car or outright ban the sale of alcohol. And rightly so, everyone makes his own decisions and the state shouId not be telling people all the time what to do! 

I dont want to be rude or blunt but there always has to be space for basic human rights, right? Restricting the personal freedom and the freedom of movement along with the right to work should be the last possible measure that is taken. Prison its the last possible measure for criminal offenders exactly because it takes away your freedom of movement and to an extent s lot of other rights. Last possible measure!

I realise that getting vaccinated is the best solution to keep people from dying, having the worst symptoms, infecting others, keeping hospitals from collapsing and so on but do we really need to force people into doing it by taking away their most basic rights? 

Why does the state has the urge to be opressive so directly, if they could just mandate, that in case of maximum capacity in the hospitals, vaccinated people will take priority or unvaccinated will have to foot the whole bill of the hospital visit or some shit like that? 

Everyone should have a choice how to live and what to do. Vulnerable groups are just that- vulnerable. It pains me to say it but that is, to an extent, their problem. And de facto locking people up for the sake of protecting the vulnerable group is nonsensical. People should discover in themselves and trough others the obligation towards those, not being forced to it or they will never learn. 

Before you tag me as an antivaxxer, I am vaccinated but only because I chose to do it. I hate being ill, I love my (elder) relatives and friends, I miss hanging out with people, travelling, going to sports matches and I believe that getting vaccinated is the best way to do it. But not in this kind of manner when a state, the very entity that is the guardian of all of its people is forcing something upon them, threatening with dire consequences if they dont do something just because they said so. I believe that kind of mentality is ill fated and can be catastrophic in certian cases. 

Educate, not punish the people for their ignorance. Punishment is better for evolving and improving people and society than education in very few cases.",1

If someone act so extremely selfish and want to harm the society, I think it's only fair the society repay the same to them. Vaccine is absolutely not a personal choice, unless you decide not to meet any person in your life.

Edit: if government do this to every mandate decision that education is the best solution, we will see traffic police explains for hours to driver refuse to wear seatbelts and drunk driving.

I have a trauma based extreme phobia, so extreme I've refused surgery for a simple problem that may become lethal, so extreme that being prepped for a blood test while in A&E put me in such a state I had a psychotic break with paranoid delusions and spent an entire day in front of my balcony window, convinced that if I took my eyes off the road for a second men in white coats would pull in, section me and take away my right to say no to any IV treatment. I've asked time and time again for treatment and the NHS won't do anything for me, and the little they have offered me has done nothing. I can't get vaccinated and everyone immediately assumes I'm anti vax or that I can just 'look away' while I'm vaxxed.
Edit to add; your down votes only further prove why people get driven to the conspiracy ridden anti vax crowd. More flies with honey than vinegar and all that. I've never experienced empathy from people that advocate for things like this.",1

I think if a qualified health professional can document this for you, you should be exempt from a vaccine mandate (but not necessarily exempt from a lockdown for the unvaccinated in the next 6 months; a year or two into the future, when covid has subsided further, you should be exempt from lockdowns as well, just as even the generally unvaccinated should then be exempt).",0

I'd love for the government of Spain to introduce this same measure in my country.

I know people who died of cancer and that's such a small percent too. And i know the likely hood of long term affects are so low but again they still potentially exist. This is forcing people to take a shot in the arm if they want to live a normal life, its a dangerous prescient to set. When everyone's vaccine effectiveness wanes after 8 months are we going to also force everyone to get it every year? Just so we can give farma companies billions every year?

If you are vaccinated why do you care if someone isn't? that is their choice and risk to take. We wont ever get rid of covid if that's your argument. I wish i didn't feel pressure to get this jab because i would have been perfectly fine without it.",1

So they can advise a nationwide lockdown, but they can't force an individual state to do something. What they can do is use the budget for items that go to states in the form of grants or direct payments, kind of is leverage. Either a carrot or a stick. It's a carrot if they're going to give new funding but only if the state either uses the executive or the state legislature to pass rules around shutdowns, masks, contact tracing etc. If they go the stick methodology, they could withhold transportation funds, agriculture funds, stuff like that contingent upon the state behaving correctly. If I recall correctly, but don't quote me on this, I believe that's the way the seat belt laws got adopted nationwide. The government basically held highway and transportation funding hostage until and unless a state agreed to adopt and enforce those laws.

It's tricky. It's complicated, we have one intractable side of the fence here that still seems to believe that the pandemic is just not a thing, and then we've got the other side that's just basically doing science and everything they said months ago is happening today. Not a shock. Never had to happen. But this is what Presidents do. they use their levers judiciously to compel an outcome that does the most good for the most people. Or at least that's how it's supposed to work. They have liaisons that work with state and local governments precisely to accomplish things like this. We should have been doing this since the initial briefing that indicated that we were going to be in serious trouble with this pandemic in short order. I certainly hope an incoming new administration here in the US gets there act together. It's way too late, but still better late than never.",0

But you need massive stimuli to save businesses. In Germany we have a shutdown right now for bars and restaurants.

For these industries, I can't see how this is true.  If you freeze rental payments, and they stop employing people, this isn't really true.  A vast majority of business expenses disappear while not operating in an active capacity.  You then apply the same to staff - living costs revert to a minimum when people only have to pay for food and utilities when rent and travel prices are removed from the equation.

It doesn't make a lot of sense that when this is applied globally across a large number of industries, an economy should collapse the way people are claiming.",0

At best, half the country would simply ignore the order. At worst, a federal call for lockdown would be met with riots. At least 70 million people want nothing to do with this. Like it or not, Trump voters render large scale lockdowns infeasible and meaningless.

Next, a lot of these medical experts are politically inept and need to shut the hell up to the press. Allow the administration to speak for itself. Don't waste political capital so carelessly. The pandemic is already extremely politically fraught and thus requires strict messaging. Cut the open mic shit.

And the federal government doesn't have this kind of power. A blanket shutdown isn't even up for discussion.  It isn't legal, and even if it were, it would be a motherfucking calamity if not paired with a truly massive relief package, which I think we can all agree with a Republican Senate is (at best) unlikely. Cutting funding to the states that won't shut down is another dumbass idea that would be a political catastrophe. 

Focus on efficacious policy that is realistic. Marshal the resources of the federal government to ramp up messaging about mask wearing and continued social distancing. Push the candidates running in Georgia to commit to voting for a relief package. And give people confidence that the vaccine and its dissemination is reason enough to fight against Covid fatigue.",1

I don't think a second lock down would be beneficial at all. It's kinda like reverse psychology with the USA. You tell people not to do something and they will want to do it even more. And morale is low right now, lock down declaration would result in more protests. I think a better strategy is to only lock down high spreading areas (bars, restaurants, gyms or whatever). Pay those people and businesses. Push for social distancing and masks when out and about. Keep pushing education non stop. Same goes for a mandatory vaccine. Don't tell people they have to get it but make it extremely easy. Make sure it's free no matter if they have insurance or not.

A lockdown of 4 to 6 weeks I think will only slow the rate of increase. If the lockdown is very strict, you might see a decline... but then it will pick right back up again when the lockdown ends. 

Hard to know if it's worth taking another hit to the economy just to try to temporarily slow the spread. I think if hospitals really start to get overrun, they will probably lockdown again in those areas. At this point... it's all about surviving the next 6 to 12 months until the vaccine gets here. It will be a balancing act between slowing the spread and protecting the economy.

It was too blanket and not strong enough.  
It was basically half assed and didn’t snuff out the virus.  
It also cost us a ton of money.  

What we know now is that Americans will not allow themselves to be locked down.  
I think that a solution that keeps the most people employed while shutting down F2F interactions that are unnecessary is what will be best.  
All offices should be legally mandated to be shut down.  
WFH works; some may prefer to be in an office but it is not needed.  
Restaurants need to be forced to go back to the curbside / delivery model.  
Schools need to be put on a 100% virtual model.  

We can have our grocery stores keep running as normal and obviously hospitals as well.  
Anything that is actually and truly non essential to have F2F interaction must be shut down hard though.  

I’d be more than happy to see an emergency UBI test implemented, even if proven to be abused in some cases.  
Seeing taxes rise to cover it is something I’d have no issue with either, knowing that I would likely see a pretty massive financial hit from it.

While it will reduce transmission rates and allow most people who are exposed to it to seek treatment and recover, the moment the lockdown ends whoever is exposed to a long-haul Covid carrier has the potential to restart the spread of the virus. Additional complacency that comes with a lockdown ending equating to ""We beat it! No more masks, no more social distancing, let's party!"" will fuel its spread. This will soon be followed by resistance to masks/social distancing because ""Remember, we beat it!"" and followed later by resistance to any more lockdowns because ""If we need another lockdown it means the last lockdown didn't work so this one won't either!""

&#x200B;

In February, a 6-week lockdown could have had the virus contained to a handful of known cases isolated in hospitals, carefully monitored by the government and with contact tracing resources ready to contain any cases that make it out into the wild. Today, it might take 6 months of lockdown to get to that point. This is the reality of the ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure.

&#x200B;

What will work is reducing the spread, which means that the federal government passes down mask guidelines to states, who will receive federal funding to assist in mask distribution when when state mandates meet the federal guidelines: the state governments mandate mask usage in public spaces, social gatherings, and enclosed areas; and mandates certain business closures to public access when case rates per county increase beyond a certain threshold. When a vaccine becomes available, a similar federal program is set up to assist states in encouraging high vaccination rates, with more assistance provided when states hit percentage milestones for their population. States that take the threat seriously get more assistance to deal with it. States that don't will have to deal with the virus on their own - and eventually will come around when their populations start saying that the government should do more - the federal government is ready, just waiting for the state to take action.",1

A lockdown inherently *will* work in the immediate sense. The virus transmits through human contact, and if a population stays confined to their immediate social circle, the virus cannot spread. 

A lockdown may be perceived to “not work” as a result of post hoc behavior in the population. If at the end of the lockdown, people assume the virus “is over” and fully go back to normal (defined as minimal mask wearing and social distancing behaviors), a resurgence will occur that negates any beneficial effect of the lockdown, in which it will ultimately be perceived to have failed. 

So the only way a lockdown will achieve the intended result is if behaviors following it are modified to continue to suppress viral transmission. An important nuance that I believe is being missed from time to time.",1

The main purpose of lockdown isn't to acclimate people to disease prevention measures, it's to build up resources like hospital capacity, testing capacity, and contact tracing so they don't get overwhelmed by a deluge of cases. If people aren't wearing masks or social distancing after a lockdown lifts, that's definitely bad, but it's an orthogonal issue.  
  
Related to that: I really think we should have been holding our officials feet to the fire a bit more when it comes to testing and contact tracing. We were told over and over again during those very costly lockdowns in the spring that we needed to do this to build up those things. But here we are, six months later and it still takes days to get a test result back and then multiple days after that before your contacts are identified and told to quarantine.  
  
This was supposed to be the *core* of our strategy. Yet nobody seems to care that we're still doing a terrible job. Not the officials, not the people, nobody. Do a ctrl-F for ""contact tracing"" in a COVID thread on reddit and you're lucky to get a single hit.

Then you reopen and 2 months later you do another lockdown at 15K/day then a 1 month lockdown to get to 500/day. Then reopen and 2 months later you have 5000/day.

Yes in a perfect lockdown. Where everyone lives in a bubble with a independent air supply and the world completely shuts down. No violations of rules, no essential services such as governments, power, fire, police. That’s not possible.

Maintaining strict mask and SD measures forever might reduce infections, but then you've admitted that you are destroying people's chances to form, build and enjoy relationships with family and friends for good (or until there's a silver bullet vaccine, which  is at least 5 years away and may never appear).

I think the civil unrest will amount to an annoyance more than anything, but the worst of it can be avoided with aggressive mask use and social distancing. 

Lockdowns are for areas that repeated refuse to wear masks and social distance enough or rush to open businesses that just aren't viable likely until a vaccine comes out. You can also get unlucky and just have a big outbreak in specific area and then lockdowns makes the most sense. Over a wide area they are less effective and harsher on the public than convincing them to wear masks and social distancce.

If you follow the rules you can have 90% of your workforce working right through the peaks of the pandemic, but if you push for 100% you will get screwed and wind up regressing. Just keep the highest risk businesses shutdown and stop trying to open them. You can't have indoor gatherings and indoor dining is just stupid. Nobody needs those things and it's costing the world trillions per month to half ass all this shit.

All the indoor dining and sport events and bars add up to a minor chunk of any nations economy. You can just run a profitable enough economy without them for an extended period of time vs rush back to normal when there is no reason to think that's actually possible.

In any case, there is the proof, don't follow the rules and rush back to work and you get fucked and lose MORE money than if you just throttle down 10-15% of your workers. The essential workers and work from home people are the vast majority of the workforce in most nations.

Soo keep the essential workers safe, keep relief to the hard hit industries and their workers and keep everybody wear masks and social distancing until 2021. It's not actually that hard and you can run a profitable economy like that and things will return to normal over time.",0

Countries need to get really serious  about mask wearing, offering them for free and imposing fines on those who aren't wearing them and also crack down on large gatherings. Despite the focus on the US, a lot of European countries have been pretty lax about mask wearing, some governments still saying it doesn't do anything and they're pointless. You can search for ""walking tours of {european / uk city}"" within the past several months on Youtube and see a lot of people on the streets without masks on. 

Both indoor and outdoor places need to have mandated temp checks for customers entering and limited capacity (indoors), anyone coughing frequently needs to be kicked out asap and for the indoor part, they need to open doors and windows with fans blowing indoor air towards the outside. This is a big issue with resurants and bars as people will have their masks down and talking a lot. Workers cannot be allowed to walk around with their mask around their neck or their nose fully exposed. 

I think with these measures, the cases will drop back down and we won't need to lock down. People will resist that just like in the US but if they are given all the facts when this is done and the alternatives like full lock downs, I think some of those people will accept it but there will always be some resisting who just want everything to go back to normal and don't think the mortality rate is high enough to warrant the mitigation efforts (or think it's a ""hoax"" altogether).",1

The people in my area are so bad that community and religious leaders are actively trying to force sick people from seeing a doctor or getting tested. Our numbers are down because of this (if you don’t text, we won’t have any cases. 

Even with the first lockdown, we’re isolated enough that no one shut anything down. 

Even out mayor publicly announced that no sacrifice was too great to make more money (we are not in a poor area). And said that those who died would have eventually died anyway.",1

Most people who get it don't even get symptoms 🙄. Most the covid deaths were really deaths from pre existing conditions. Not the covid itself. They are just trying to shut everything down.

The situation is extremely dire. And the third phase means vaccine is already working they are just checking to be 1000% sure with more participants than before. It's insane to wait any longer for possible side effects if the vaccine already works when Europe soon will have up to 100K cases a day at this rate.,1

It's difficult to get a test still, our track and trace sucks, and it doesn't seem like we've really increased our number of ventilators or beds.
