Forced city closure and quarantine or people's self-discipline and responsibility will objectively indicate that the epidemic has finally been brought under control.

 [An unpreventable separation of life and death]

 Wuhan was closed down for over a month. In addition to the siege, the government held up the “anti-epidemic results” of the reduction in new confirmed cases while promoting the positive “warm news” of the epidemic. Various regions are also speeding up their efforts one after another to resume work and resume production. 

However, within the besieged city, normal life could not be resumed. The hasty death left no room to say goodbye.
