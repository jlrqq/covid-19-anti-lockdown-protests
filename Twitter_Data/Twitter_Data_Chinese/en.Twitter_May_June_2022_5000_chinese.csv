It turned out to be yellow only when there was an epidemic. I don't know when it became yellow without nucleic acid. Has it recovered now? Not at all. Second, it turns out that the nucleic acid results before the closure of Shanghai were shown by CT values. Are CT values shown now? CT values have not been shown since they were manipulated by the nucleic acid faction in order to conceal falsification. It's still too early for the blockade to actually be lifted.

First, there is no vaccine, no supplies. Many people don't have any money, but if they have money, they can't necessarily buy supplies. Being imprisoned from the beginning of February to the end of April was really uncomfortable. I owed a lot of money to my credit card at the time. I was only paid the minimum wage during the blocking period. I couldn't repay my loan at all. I was fined a lot of late fees by the bank, and I still owe tens of thousands of debts",swb_wh,,

News of city closures has continued to circulate in various provinces and cities, and there have occasionally been confirmed cases of Hong Kong imported into the mainland, which has undoubtedly made customs clearance more difficult.

 A month after the closure of Shanghai, the epidemic prevention target was quietly revised down from ‚Äúdynamic clean-up‚Äù to ‚Äúsocial clean-up.‚Äù Beijing, the capital of China, has also closed dozens of subway stations and bus routes due to the spread of the epidemic. China's zero-epidemic prevention policy has once again sparked discussion. Analysts said that China wants to suppress the death of a large number of people, but the number of people immunized by the population is far from sufficient.

Xi Jinping presided over the Central Committee on Finance and Economics on Tuesday, stressing the importance of infrastructure for economic development. Also, according to overseas media, Xi Jinping recently called for ensuring that the growth rate of China's economy exceeds that of the US this year. Up to now, China's strict ‚Äúzero out‚Äù epidemic closure policy has brought the economy almost to a standstill. What is the purpose of Xi Jinping's move?

 epidemic continues to spread in Changchun City, Jilin Province. It has been over a month since the closure of the city. On April 13, a Lianhuashan villager working in Changchun told Epoch Times that it was the spring farming season. Currently, she is neither able to return to her hometown for spring farming, nor can she return to Changchun, and is stuck on her way.

 China imposed a continuous lockdown on Shanghai. Not only did it not contain the spread of the epidemic, but it also hit Shanghai's economy hard. In particular, many small and micro enterprises are facing extinction. Independent economist Gong Shengli said that the cost of the closure of the Shanghai epidemic is as high as 10 billion yuan per day. If it continues or spreads to the surrounding area, the situation will be quite serious

But every time I saw the same thing happen again and again, I was still so angry. 
The indifference and ironcleness of the policies, the reluctance of the epidemic prevention personnel to only listen to orders, the cowardly obedience of the quarantined people, etc., have really turned the city in the midst of the epidemic into Aussinwei. 
Looking at this kind of thing, I just feel depressed and helpless, and I have no place to rest my heart.",nkk2bzohexhuud7,,
