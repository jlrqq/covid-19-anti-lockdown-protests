The plan, as sold to basically every developed nation from day one, was to take the number of people who would be infected by and, yes, even die from this disease and stretch them out over a longer time horizon.  We were trying to stretch the X-axis while keeping the Y-axis lower.  Yes, this can result in fewer overall infections, but the bulk of people who would ultimately be infected or exposed to infection is still a majority of the population.

Lockdowns can only be justified on the basis of EXCESS mortality caused by inadequate medical capacity (ie. the curve exceeding the capacity line).  There is no difference between 300 deaths per million being spread out over 6 months or happening in 2 months, so long as the peak does not cause that number of deaths to skyrocket to 400 or 500 deaths per million because of inadequate supply of hospital resources.

What we know now is that hospital capacity is exceeding demand in most places, to the point where we have empty hospitals and sufferers of other afflictions being pushed aside.  The curve is flattened well below where it needs to be.

Before you throw Sweden vs. Norway vs. Denmark out there, consider this question is Sweden going to have substantially more deaths per million than those countries when all is said and done?  Or are they just going through them a little quicker?  Is Sweden suffering from **excess** mortality compared to other countries due to their decisions?  Are they running out of capacity causing unnecessary loss of life?

THANK YOU!

Here in Canada practically every hospital is well under projections. Ontario was supposed to have 1000-1200 people in the ICU a couple days ago, they had 289. Despite the fact it was nearly 4x lower than projected, headlines called it a ""Glimmer of Hope"" and the Premier extended the state of emergency. There are many reports of nurses and medical staff having hours reduced because the hospitals do not have patients. This has an impact on people who would otherwise be getting treatment; how do we justify the lockdown to a person whos cancer metastasized because their appointment was postponed when the hospital was empty? How do we count their death statistically? 

Trudeau suggested today that a gradual reopening of the economy may happen in the next few weeks. My hunch is that they are still using the modeling that suggested a peak in May, but that models validity and reliability comes into question when you consider how inaccurate the predictions have been. Now to be fair, we have seen a doubling in reported deaths today from what had been reported yesterday (63 to 123), so it is possible that we have not yet reached the peak. However it remains to be seen if this was an outlier or a backlog of cases from the long weekend, as deaths have been relatively stable until now. Also, 118 of those 123 deaths came from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. It seems clear to me that in all other provinces the pandemic has reached its peak and could begin reducing social distancing measures immediately.

Wrong. They should mostly be an opportunity to roll out an efficient testing protocol nation wide (which should be at least of the magnitute of 100k tests for a medium sized nation in order to address almost immediatly any new infection nest), to screen sieroconverted people with sierological testing, to make people understand what theyll inevitably go through again in case they wont respect social distances for the next year or wear masks, to build PPE in country in a war-time like fashion and not to rely on foreign enflated markets and makers.

Lifting a lockdown without these things sorted out, and they will be very difficult for anyone to be sorted out in a half dozen of weeks, will inhevitably bring a nation on the brink collapse again after less than two months, since the virus will be always circulating again from the start at sub-clinical levels.

You can upgrade your icu beds nationwide by a factor of 2, 3, 4, even 5, but youll never know when and where the next infection will start. At that point, 500 icu beds rather than 100 in that metropolitan center will help you only that much. Considering you reach again the point of infections needed to saturate your previous ICU infrastructure (so lets say indeed 100 beds) you only need to wait (so to fuck around ) around a week more to saturate your upgraded infrastructure. So long icu beds bought with the blood and tears of your first lockdown. Theyll go down the shitter in a matter of days. And I believe it could be pretty easy to fuck up in case the testing protocols wont be capillary. The margin is extremely thin once the curve starts to skyrocket, and in case you dont have an efficient testing net its very easy to let the curve grow again unnoticed.

Hospital capacity will risk saturating in any case if another lockdown will risk being needed. Its much more efficient and logical to divert the priority on developing a survellaince infracture so that the hospital capacity of today keeps being enough.

Unfortunately the best methods would be with the use of testing/antibody testing (that arent ready yet) and measures that fundamentally go against traditionally American ideals of freedom; like mandatory tracking, etc.

In the interim we would need to have phases for reopening, guidelines and rules to maintain social distancing, wearing masks, requiring businesses to close midday for cleaning. All the while mandating companies that can work from home, work from home, and those that cant, provide rolling systems that rotate in workers. This, in theory, would be very communal in nature and limiting restaurants to half to 1/4 capacity to provide space between patrons.

Schools would be the same way. Classrooms would cut class sizes by 2/3rds and only come to school 1 day a week on a rotating basis while distance learning the remainder of the time.

Sports would come back, but players would have to be tested and obviously not play to large crowds until a vaccine or herd immunity is reached.

Older and at risk populations should still stay home and/or only allowed to go out on certain days. Im not sure how this would work. But Id imaging something like those with a certain social security number range can go out at certain times etc.

Again these are just brainstorms of what I think may happen. I do know that people will get restless if there isnt an effort to reopen in another month or so.

There’s no way half of your suggestions would work (certainly not in America where people feel entitled, right or wrong) because it would be “infringing” on people’s rights. One of my growing concerns and questions as this goes on and people throw out suggestions on what to do how many rights are we willing to give up to solve an essentially unsolvable problem (is this isn’t going to just go away, it’s not a black and white situation with any absolutes other then we’ll always live with this). And this is coming from a place of remembering post-9/11 and the Patriot Act. Yes, some of those measures “worked” but at the cost of doing irreparable harm and consolidating power that has been abused and manipulated for private interests.

I think what will most likely happen, is that things will open back up. Measures will be taken and they simply won’t be draconian enough. People will have a greater false sense of security (which I think the use of “masks” is gradually creating and easing us into) and there will be a second wave that will be absolutely demoralizing and drive people not only back into their homes, but to do their own contact-testing. Fear-mongering that will be enmeshed in racism, classism—whatever tangible othering that might give one a sense of control over what is quickly unfolding.

People might, for a time, accept the deaths occurring and rationalize them. But if this gets out of control or mutates, people will quickly be driven back into their homes not out of government order, but out of fear. And that’s far more deadly.

We can accept that this is the new normal, or we can be stubbornly opposed and refuse to adjust our lives accordingly. There’s an arrogance of imperviousness our modern-times lends itself to. An inflexibility woven into the rat-race speed we’ve grown accustomed to. 

Obviously this can all play out a number of different ways. And maybe we’ll get a more positive outcome.

The Chinese also seem to have guidance to maximize ventilation, fresh air circulation.

I concede many of the previous ways of doing things were very sloppy with no attention paid to transmission of respiratory illnesses.

If the eastern countries are successful, we shouldnt we try to imitate the process? If the tracking is invasive, isnt that better than death? If a lot of people die, 1) it could be someone you know that you didnt think would die, 2) it could be you, even though you think that it shouldnt be, 3) if intelligencia and mid-level leaders die our brain trust will be depleted, which results in a poorer outlook for you, your descendants, our economy, and there may be unintended consequences like poorer medical care because research goes down, poor decision-making results, and government instability happens, 4) if a lot of people are sick, they are either too sick to spend money, or they feel sad because someone they know is sick so they dont spend money.  We have a huge country, similar to many countries put together, so if we are re-opening, then maybe quarantining off states or sections of multiple states, like smaller countries do, might make sense to try contain the virus and preserve contact tracing, until vast testing and or a vaccine is found. It sounds like we will need a lot of $ and a lot of taxes to bail the country out. Also, we have to weigh lives against utility, does it make sense to have a lot of people die for entertainment or sport? Are certain industries crucial for functioning and security that we have to preserve? Can we pivot to employ people in areas and so they can still work in a way that is safe for the population at large including the vulnerable, without tributes or darwinian thinking? How do we rationalize whose life is more valuable and whose are disposable when we pick ourselves as part of that more valuable population, and or we pick ourselves as becoming self-enriched by the decision equation at the expense of others lives, anyway? We were in a world war for 4 years and everyone made sacrifices for four years. Weve been in this current situation for about a month. We can be stronger than one months worth, as a nation, I think. Are we strong enough to last 13 weeks? Can some of us go back to work six to 13 feet apart like we see in the factory pictures? We can survive this together, change and become stronger. But we need government help and strategy and we all have to make some sacrifices, rather than some people called upon to make all of the sacrifice, especially without their choosing. Going fast medically and scientifically  makes sense.  I dont think we should pivot the industry too fast in either direction and because it sounds like it needs lead time to adjust to what it is already trying to change and meet, otherwise our haste to reopen for fear of our jobs and lack of a high level of entertainment could backfire.",1,sveden, neutral,  0.9899393916130066},  approval,  0.005546689033508301},  fear,0.001024344

This ""remove lockdown cuz economy"" mentality is waaaay easier said than done. Just letting the virus ""wash over"" and kill millions of vulnerable  people might not destroy the economy as badly (it cant be saved either way), but would have disastrous social and psychological effects,  and unless every country decides to do the same, those that do will be seen as inhumane and even genocidal, which would reshape the food chain in the world. You dont wanna be the country that picked money over saving lives.

Another thing that really concerns me of such a scenario, is health care workers, months of extreme lockdown-less load would be impossible to handle, not only they would be at a constant risk of a high-viral load exposure and many would die, we would see strikes demanding action, and the endless need for resources would also be a massive amount of money. All of this would also raise the death rate of pretty much any disease and accident out there.

Shouldnt there be a way to simply self-quarantine for 14 or 21 days, after which time we could be allowed back into the world?

I have to believe there are cell phone apps that could assure the quarantine. It would be cheaper to buy every person on the planet a phone, and to develop an app to do the tracking, than what we are paying for all of the other shutdown processes.

If the whole world quarantined for 14 days at the same time, wouldnt the answer to all of our testing issues be solved?

They said dont close the border. They didnt say let people travel freely.

This detail is often lost in internet discussion. The experts say, let people travel, but do health screening, do isolation and quarantine, do contact tracing. This is basically what the Asia Pacific countries did, and they are mostly fairing pretty well.

If every country had done this early, the virus would have been contained. But they didnt. The high number of infection across the world means that its no longer feasible for smaller countries to isolate and screen all international traveler, so it is now necessary to close the border.

For example, Canadas pandemic preparation plan basically says

""In theory travel restrictions could work if you stopped 99% of all air travel, but it would be so economically damaging that it wouldnt be worth doing. Were a large country that relies a lot on cross-border trade (with the US), so we cant do that, only small island countries can"".

> Restricting  99%  of  air  travel  could  provide  an  additional  1-2  months  for  vaccine  administration. However, such drastic restrictions are not economically feasible and are predicted to delay  viral  spread  but  not  impact  overall  morbidity.

> In general,  border  control  has  limited  effectiveness   in   large   countries   with   porous  borders.  Given  the  current  scale  of  air  transport,  effective  border  control  would  require  unrealistic  detection  rates  in  order  to  delay  or  limit  transmission.  However,  border  control  may  be  effective  in  small  island  settings  with  a   limited   number   of   travellers   where   quarantine   of   incoming   travellers   for   >8.6  days  could  have  99%  effectiveness  in  preventing  the  release  of  infectious  individuals   into   the   community.

The government implemented a stringent countrywide lockdown (designated Alert Level 4) on March 26. During this period of exponentially increasing local cases, many people wondered whether these intensive controls would work. After 5 weeks, and with the number of new cases declining rapidly, New Zealand moved to Alert Level 3 for an additional 2 weeks, resulting in a total of 7 weeks of what was essentially a national stay-at-home order.

It should also be highlighted New Zealand was extremely transparent about sharing credible modelling with the public from early on.

However going to the current top comment. Not all of it.

If they werent able to effectively shut down borders they would have been re-infected and achieved the destroyed economy plus high COVID death outcome.  Similarly if people did not widely comply the same outcome would occur.  

California had some of the earliest and strictest lock downs, they eased those lock downs late as well.  However they are now dealing with it over and over.  New York got Waxed early but is not seeing any significant increase in cases now that restrictions are lifting.

It seems in the united states the full elimination plan is doomed, due to 50 independent governments and a ""dont tell me what to do"" population.

The risky approach is trying to stop it due to the worst of both worlds outcome upon failure, and the fact that the government is only a small part of the success or failure of it. I can see why people would have a problem with just letting it run rampant though.  

Hindsight being 20/20, places like the USA take a flatten the curve approach like they were planning to do from the start before that paper came out. Places like New Zealand eradicate it and wait for a vaccine.

No known trace of the original virus persists per our state’s chief health officer. Hence Australia had also inadvertently eliminated.

Melbourne (population similar to NZ) is now in its harshest lockdown yet to try and again achieve elimination (trying to maintain a “suppression strategy” with a small amount of local transmission didn’t work, prompting the Australian Government to recently change its stance and state its goal is now “zero community transmission”) but starting from significant levels of community transmission and hundreds of cases per day, which NZ never had.

we urgently need an app that saves your location info locally on your phone (if you are concerned for your privacy) or online (china already has this, korea as well from what i heard) and only IF you get infected can share the data. to prevent misuse only doctors and health authorities should be able to unlock the infection status.

the location could be saved locally, but it should be possible for everyone to trace back the route of infected people on a map and get warnings, if they have been close to someone infected.

this would make it much easier to know if you have been at risk and can self contain or at least be much more careful not to infect anyone else.

the big tech companies should have had something like this ready for months. what are they waiting for. facebook and other social media platforms should also have an option to input this info there, so people can see that friends got infected. of course you need to verify infections by health authorites there as well, so that people do not randomly put their status as infected.",0,m phone sorry t want pretty strong effort trace 3 2 1 d assorted reason bad end remove phone hell, neutral,  0.7742335796356201},  remorse,  0.16031618416309357},  approval,0.024295982

Edit

It is also possible to do it mostly without sharing any data. If only people who had a positive test share the date with everybody, then the app can look if you where close to a positive tested person.

The app should be open source


Edit 2

You dont even need location data, it is possible to make a rough distance estimate to another phone with bluetooth. Every app gets needs to share its id with the other persons you meet.

The virus doesnt care what the government policies are. The virus only cares about what people are actually doing. I suggest you look at what is happening on the street to get a better idea of what ""lockdown measures \[being\] softened"" actually looks like.

Youll notice a few things from those screenshots and the second video

1. About 60-80% of people are wearing masks in May, and most of the masks are rather high-quality surgical or KN95 masks, not cloth or sponge masks.

2. There were less than 10% as many people on the street as normal.

2. About half of the stores are still closed.

3. The open stores have measures in place to mitigate contagion. Signs encourage store patrons to [use masks and disinfectant, and to stand 2m apart](https//youtu.be/P3aswVH8S40?t=25), and to [enter the store one at a time to avoid contagion](https//youtu.be/P3aswVH8S40?t=59). Cafes are not allowing customers indoors, and are instead [serving them outside](https//youtu.be/P3aswVH8S40?t=101) at the storefront.

That isnt surprising.  Not everyone is going back to business-as-usual with behaviors the same as Jan/early-Feb.  A lot of people are still choosing to act like stay at home orders are still in effect.  Many people that are out are still social distancing.  The virus wont start doubling every 3 days again.  It looks like in multiple US states the virus is hitting roughly 2-3 week long doubling times and it will take some time for those numbers to build up (see https//epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-states/).  Those states are all seeing upticks now, but itll probably be another 2-3 weeks before the trend starts to be really measurable.

People who check almost all the lists for COVID symptoms still test negative on antibody tests months after the first symptom appeared. Question is if that is balanced out by possible false positives.

There is also some evidence of some people only having mucosal antibodies against COVID (which might not prevent infection). It seems that some cases do not develop antibodies, or detectable ones anyway.

I concur on the second wave theory though. Weve already seen the rapid rise of the D614G mutation, and social distancing will increase the evolutionary pressure to find new ways to spread infection.",0,removed, neutral,  0.8477322459220886},  anger,  0.11620229482650757},  sadness,0.007285314

If I understand right, theyre saying that if R0 = 2.5 and you want to get it down to 1.0, then you can do that by cutting down to 1/2.5 = 0.4x normal contacts. Or, assuming a serial interval of a week, you can alternate six-week periods with full normal contacts, during which the case count will go up by a factor of 2.5^6 = 244, followed by six-week periods with R = (1/244)^(1/6) = 1/R0 = 0.4, during which it will go back down. For R = 0.4 you need 0.16x normal contacts.

Assuming that your utility is proportional to average number of contacts, the intermittent case is better, since (1 + 0.16)/2 = 0.58 > 0.4. Then they also show that under various broader assumptions about utility, the result still holds, and claim the intermittent also has fewer infected (and thus fewer deaths; though Im not sure of their assumptions there, since I dont understand why the steady Reff = 1 case is resting at the maximum from the intermittent, and not the minimum or somewhere in between). I understand from their references that the basic idea that alternating strict/loose may be better than steady intermediate is already known in epidemiology, and the now-famous Ferguson paper had actually modeled it at the end in Figure 4.

Good luck actually implementing that, though. Maybe the practical challenges could be managed if the schedule was predictable, but thats still a pretty awkward way to run a factory/restaurant/whatever, with a cost in that complexity that their model doesnt capture. And the comments here show that while the (unrealistic) ""lock down really hard until the virus is eradicated"" has some political popularity, this clearly does not.

However, there are quite a few assumptions that are made that need to be addressed.

1. Compliance. They have assumed a high degree of compliance with the strict measures when they are in effect. Lack of compliance can bridge the gap between cycles, reducing their effects to a larger degree than with longer, less stringent measures.

2. Testing. The concept of using controlled cycles to optimize results is based on both regular testing, and a short period for results. At this time there are still large portions of the US that do not have adequate testing. In addition, infected individuals are often not aware of their status for a week or more. When you are looking at cycles that can be as short as two weeks, this is highly problematic.

3. Quarantine. The assumption is always made that individuals that are identified as infected are quarantined, and removed from community spread. Unfortunately this is not the case, as there is an  ever increasing amount of acceptance for infected individuals interacting in the community. It has even gotten to the point in the US where Congress is looking to pass laws protecting companies if they allow for infected individuals to remain at work (especially in jobs considered essential).

Saving lives is the point.  You can argue that the cost isnt worth it, but to say there is no point is to pretend this virus cant spread.  

Assuming the spread of this virus will have the same reaction to warm weather as the spread of coronaviruses where the population is always near herd immunity so slight fluctuations of R0 will bring it above and below 11 is not sensible.

* Dont tolerate coughers. If someone caughs once, remove him or leave.

Rationale Caughing into ones face travels farther than 2m. Face masks dont help in this case. Most (90%) infected think theyve only got a cold. 

* Dont sing or shout into anyones direction. 

Rationale
While caughing is the most likely distribution, singing or shouting directly at someone is the 2nd most likely distribution, far more likely than droplets or by surface. 

The rest is standard hygiene, like dont touch your face or wash your hands.",1,, neutral,  0.9945245981216431},  approval,  0.0027153717819601297},  admiration,0.000881282
