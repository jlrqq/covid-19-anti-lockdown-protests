The plan, as sold to basically every developed nation from day one, was to take the number of people who would be infected by and, yes, even die from this disease and stretch them out over a longer time horizon.  We were trying to stretch the X-axis while keeping the Y-axis lower.  Yes, this can result in fewer overall infections, but the bulk of people who would ultimately be infected or exposed to infection is still a majority of the population.

Lockdowns can only be justified on the basis of EXCESS mortality caused by inadequate medical capacity (ie. the curve exceeding the capacity line).  There is no difference between 300 deaths per million being spread out over 6 months or happening in 2 months, so long as the peak does not cause that number of deaths to skyrocket to 400 or 500 deaths per million because of inadequate supply of hospital resources.

What we know now is that hospital capacity is exceeding demand in most places, to the point where we have empty hospitals and sufferers of other afflictions being pushed aside.  The curve is flattened well below where it needs to be.

Before you throw Sweden vs. Norway vs. Denmark out there, consider this question: is Sweden going to have substantially more deaths per million than those countries when all is said and done?  Or are they just going through them a little quicker?  Is Sweden suffering from **excess** mortality compared to other countries due to their decisions?

THANK YOU!

Here in Canada practically every hospital is well under projections. Ontario was supposed to have 1000-1200 people in the ICU a couple days ago, they had 289. Despite the fact it was nearly 4x lower than projected, headlines called it a ""Glimmer of Hope"" and the Premier extended the state of emergency. There are many reports of nurses and medical staff having hours reduced because the hospitals do not have patients. This has an impact on people who would otherwise be getting treatment; how do we justify the lockdown to a person whos cancer metastasized because their appointment was postponed when the hospital was empty? How do we count their death statistically? 

Trudeau suggested today that a gradual reopening of the economy may happen in the next few weeks. My hunch is that they are still using the modeling that suggested a peak in May, but that models validity and reliability comes into question when you consider how inaccurate the predictions have been. Now to be fair, we have seen a doubling in reported deaths today from what had been reported yesterday (63 to 123), so it is possible that we have not yet reached the peak. However it remains to be seen if this was an outlier or a backlog of cases from the long weekend, as deaths have been relatively stable until now. Also, 118 of those 123 deaths came from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. It seems clear to me that in all other provinces the pandemic has reached its peak and could begin reducing social distancing measures immediately.

Wrong. They should mostly be an opportunity to roll out an efficient testing protocol nation wide (which should be at least of the magnitute of 100k tests for a medium sized nation in order to address almost immediatly any new infection nest), to screen sieroconverted people with sierological testing, to make people understand what theyll inevitably go through again in case they wont respect social distances for the next year or wear masks, to build PPE in country in a war-time like fashion and not to rely on foreign enflated markets and makers.

Lifting a lockdown without these things sorted out, and they will be very difficult for anyone to be sorted out in a half dozen of weeks, will inhevitably bring a nation on the brink collapse again after less than two months, since the virus will be always circulating again from the start at sub-clinical levels.

You can upgrade your icu beds nationwide by a factor of 2, 3, 4, even 5, but youll never know when and where the next infection will start. At that point, 500 icu beds rather than 100 in that metropolitan center will help you only that much. Considering you reach again the point of infections needed to saturate your previous ICU infrastructure (so lets say indeed 100 beds) you only need to wait (so to fuck around ) around a week more to saturate your upgraded infrastructure. So long icu beds bought with the blood and tears of your first lockdown. Theyll go down the shitter in a matter of days. And I believe it could be pretty easy to fuck up in case the testing protocols wont be capillary. The margin is extremely thin once the curve starts to skyrocket, and in case you dont have an efficient testing net its very easy to let the curve grow again unnoticed.

Hospital capacity will risk saturating in any case if another lockdown will risk being needed. Its much more efficient and logical to divert the priority on developing a survellaince infracture so that the hospital capacity of today keeps being enough.

You know, I dont think were mature enough to recognize what *a lot* of dead people is either. Were conditioned to think some deaths (chronic, perennial health problems) are okay while others (transient causes of death) are tragedies. When you apply *anything* to the entire population, you get a lot of deaths. Heart disease causes 600,000+ deaths per year. Thats 0.2% of the population. As you alluded, adding in other causes of death makes that 0.8%. By a similar metric, you can see a lot of death by virtue of any mass perturbation of the system.

Unfortunately the best methods would be with the use of testing/antibody testing (that arent ready yet) and measures that fundamentally go against traditionally American ideals of freedom; like mandatory tracking, etc.

In the interim we would need to have phases for reopening, guidelines and rules to maintain social distancing, wearing masks, requiring businesses to close midday for cleaning. All the while mandating companies that can work from home, work from home, and those that cant, provide rolling systems that rotate in workers. This, in theory, would be very communal in nature and limiting restaurants to half to 1/4 capacity to provide space between patrons.

Schools would be the same way. Classrooms would cut class sizes by 2/3rds and only come to school 1 day a week on a rotating basis while distance learning the remainder of the time.

Sports would come back, but players would have to be tested and obviously not play to large crowds until a vaccine or herd immunity is reached.

Older and at risk populations should still stay home and/or only allowed to go out on certain days. Im not sure how this would work. But Id imaging something like those with a certain social security number range can go out at certain times etc.

Again these are just brainstorms of what I think may happen. I do know that people will get restless if there isnt an effort to reopen in another month or so.

There’s no way half of your suggestions would work (certainly not in America where people feel entitled, right or wrong) because it would be “infringing” on people’s rights. One of my growing concerns and questions as this goes on and people throw out suggestions on what to do: how many rights are we willing to give up to solve an essentially unsolvable problem (is this isn’t going to just go away, it’s not a black and white situation with any absolutes other then we’ll always live with this). And this is coming from a place of remembering post-9/11 and the Patriot Act. Yes, some of those measures “worked” but at the cost of doing irreparable harm and consolidating power that has been abused and manipulated for private interests.

I think what will most likely happen, is that things will open back up. Measures will be taken and they simply won’t be draconian enough. People will have a greater false sense of security (which I think the use of “masks” is gradually creating and easing us into) and there will be a second wave that will be absolutely demoralizing and drive people not only back into their homes, but to do their own contact-testing. Fear-mongering that will be enmeshed in racism, classism—whatever tangible othering that might give one a sense of control over what is quickly unfolding.

People might, for a time, accept the deaths occurring and rationalize them. But if this gets out of control or mutates, people will quickly be driven back into their homes not out of government order, but out of fear. And that’s far more deadly.

We can accept that this is the new normal, or we can be stubbornly opposed and refuse to adjust our lives accordingly. There’s an arrogance of imperviousness our modern-times lends itself to. An inflexibility woven into the rat-race speed we’ve grown accustomed to. 

Obviously this can all play out a number of different ways. And maybe we’ll get a more positive outcome. But eventually we’ll have to deal with how ill-prepared and unwilling we are to accommodate on every societal level, and we can kick that can down the road or be forced to deal with that new reality now.",0,don ’ t think modern time we ’ re equipped handle situation discipline sacrifice pragmatism that ’ s required there ’ s way half suggestion work certainly america people feel entitled right wrong “ infringing ” people ’ s right growing concern question go people throw suggestion right willing solve essentially unsolvable problem isn ’ t going away it ’ s black white situation absolute we ’ ll live coming place remembering post 9 11 patriot act yes measure “ worked ” cost irreparable harm consolidating power abused manipulated private interest i think likely happen thing open measure taken simply won ’ t draconian people greater false sense security think use “ mask ” gradually creating easing second wave absolutely demoralizing drive people home contact testing fear mongering enmeshed racism classism—whatever tangible othering sense control quickly unfolding people time accept death occurring rationalize get control mutates people quickly driven home government order fear that ’ s far deadly we accept new normal stubbornly opposed refuse adjust life accordingly there ’ s arrogance imperviousness modern time lends inflexibility woven rat race speed we ’ ve grown accustomed obviously play number different way maybe we ’ ll positive outcome eventually we ’ ll deal ill prepared unwilling accommodate societal level kick road forced deal new reality,neutral,0.953399122,optimism,0.02272757,realization,0.00851279

It seems like the Canadian government plans on re-opening businesses while were still in the middle of trying to reduce numbers. 

We have roughly 36 million people with majority of them being from Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia and around March 15 we had close to 320+ cases. 

One month later with quarantine procedures in place we have roughly 28,000 cases and 1000 deaths (Which Im happy those numbers are low and realize that without a quarantine early on they would be much worse) but this still feels like the early phase of the virus, and complete destruction of our healthcare system seems to be on the horizon once we have more activity in our communities and businesses. 

There are still so many people that can become sick from this virus, and it seems as though we havent even touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of number of people that may become infected.

If the eastern countries are successful, we shouldnt we try to imitate the process? If the tracking is invasive, isnt that better than death? If a lot of people die, 1) it could be someone you know that you didnt think would die, 2) it could be you, even though you think that it shouldnt be, 3) if intelligencia and mid-level leaders die our brain trust will be depleted, which results in a poorer outlook for you, your descendants, our economy, and there may be unintended consequences like poorer medical care because research goes down, poor decision-making results, and government instability happens, 4) if a lot of people are sick, they are either too sick to spend money, or they feel sad because someone they know is sick so they dont spend money.  We have a huge country, similar to many countries put together, so if we are re-opening, then maybe quarantining off states or sections of multiple states, like smaller countries do, might make sense to try contain the virus and preserve contact tracing, until vast testing and or a vaccine is found. It sounds like we will need a lot of $ and a lot of taxes to bail the country out. Also, we have to weigh lives against utility, does it make sense to have a lot of people die for entertainment or sport? Are certain industries crucial for functioning and security that we have to preserve? Can we pivot to employ people in areas and so they can still work in a way that is safe for the population at large including the vulnerable, without tributes or darwinian thinking? How do we rationalize whose life is more valuable and whose are disposable when we pick ourselves as part of that more valuable population, and or we pick ourselves as becoming self-enriched by the decision equation at the expense of others lives, anyway?

Are we strong enough to last 13 weeks? Can some of us go back to work six to 13 feet apart like we see in the factory pictures? We can survive this together, change and become stronger. But we need government help and strategy and we all have to make some sacrifices, rather than some people called upon to make all of the sacrifice, especially without their choosing.

For example, Canadas pandemic preparation plan basically says:

""In theory travel restrictions could work if you stopped 99% of all air travel, but it would be so economically damaging that it wouldnt be worth doing. Were a large country that relies a lot on cross-border trade (with the US), so we cant do that, only small island countries can"".

> Restricting  99%  of  air  travel  could  provide  an  additional  1-2  months  for  vaccine  administration. However, such drastic restrictions are not economically feasible and are predicted to delay  viral  spread  but  not  impact  overall  morbidity.

> In general,  border  control  has  limited  effectiveness   in   large   countries   with   porous  borders.  Given  the  current  scale  of  air  transport,  effective  border  control  would  require  unrealistic  detection  rates  in  order  to  delay  or  limit  transmission.

California had some of the earliest and strictest lock downs, they eased those lock downs late as well.  However they are now dealing with it over and over.  New York got Waxed early but is not seeing any significant increase in cases now that restrictions are lifting.

It seems in the united states the full elimination plan is doomed, due to 50 independent governments and a ""dont tell me what to do"" population.

The risky approach is trying to stop it due to the worst of both worlds outcome upon failure, and the fact that the government is only a small part of the success or failure of it. I can see why people would have a problem with just letting it run rampant though.  

Hindsight being 20/20, places like the USA take a flatten the curve approach like they were planning to do from the start before that paper came out. Places like New Zealand eradicate it and wait for a vaccine.

Youll notice a few things from those screenshots and the second video:

1. About 60-80% of people are wearing masks in May, and most of the masks are rather high-quality: surgical or KN95 masks, not cloth or sponge masks.

2. There were less than 10% as many people on the street as normal.

2. About half of the stores are still closed.

3. The open stores have measures in place to mitigate contagion. Signs encourage store patrons to [use masks and disinfectant, and to stand 2m apart(https://youtu.be/P3aswVH8S40?t=25), and to [enter the store one at a time to avoid contagion(https://youtu.be/P3aswVH8S40?t=59). Cafes are not allowing customers indoors, and are instead [serving them outside(https://youtu.be/P3aswVH8S40?t=101) at the storefront.

That isnt surprising.  Not everyone is going back to business-as-usual with behaviors the same as Jan/early-Feb.  A lot of people are still choosing to act like stay at home orders are still in effect.  Many people that are out are still social distancing.  The virus wont start doubling every 3 days again.  It looks like in multiple US states the virus is hitting roughly 2-3 week long doubling times and it will take some time for those numbers to build up (see https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-states/).

People who check almost all the lists for COVID symptoms still test negative on antibody tests months after the first symptom appeared. Question is if that is balanced out by possible false positives.

There is also some evidence of some people only having mucosal antibodies against COVID (which might not prevent infection). It seems that some cases do not develop antibodies, or detectable ones anyway.

I concur on the second wave theory though.

If I understand right, theyre saying that if R0 = 2.5 and you want to get it down to 1.0, then you can do that by cutting down to 1/2.5 = 0.4x normal contacts. Or, assuming a serial interval of a week, you can alternate six-week periods with full normal contacts, during which the case count will go up by a factor of 2.5^6 = 244, followed by six-week periods with R = (1/244)^(1/6) = 1/R0 = 0.4, during which it will go back down. For R = 0.4 you need 0.16x normal contacts.

Assuming that your utility is proportional to average number of contacts, the intermittent case is better, since (1 + 0.16)/2 = 0.58 > 0.4. Then they also show that under various broader assumptions about utility, the result still holds, and claim the intermittent also has fewer infected (and thus fewer deaths; though Im not sure of their assumptions there, since I dont understand why the steady Reff = 1 case is resting at the maximum from the intermittent, and not the minimum or somewhere in between). I understand from their references that the basic idea that alternating strict/loose may be better than steady intermediate is already known in epidemiology, and the now-famous Ferguson paper had actually modeled it at the end in Figure 4.

Good luck actually implementing that, though. Maybe the practical challenges could be managed if the schedule was predictable, but thats still a pretty awkward way to run a factory/restaurant/whatever, with a cost in that complexity that their model doesnt capture. And the comments here show that while the (unrealistic) ""lock down really hard until the virus is eradicated"" has some political popularity, this clearly does not.

Finally, Id note that their paper discusses the relative merits of intermittent vs. steady measures to achieve a given average, and not what that average should be.

However, there are quite a few assumptions that are made that need to be addressed.

1. Compliance. They have assumed a high degree of compliance with the strict measures when they are in effect. Lack of compliance can bridge the gap between cycles, reducing their effects to a larger degree than with longer, less stringent measures.

2. Testing. The concept of using controlled cycles to optimize results is based on both regular testing, and a short period for results. At this time there are still large portions of the US that do not have adequate testing. In addition, infected individuals are often not aware of their status for a week or more. When you are looking at cycles that can be as short as two weeks, this is highly problematic.

3. Quarantine. The assumption is always made that individuals that are identified as infected are quarantined, and removed from community spread. Unfortunately this is not the case, as there is an  ever increasing amount of acceptance for infected individuals interacting in the community. It has even gotten to the point in the US where Congress is looking to pass laws protecting companies if they allow for infected individuals to remain at work (especially in jobs considered essential).

Saving lives is the point.  You can argue that the cost isnt worth it, but to say there is no point is to pretend this virus cant spread.  

Assuming the spread of this virus will have the same reaction to warm weather as the spread of coronaviruses where the population is always near herd immunity so slight fluctuations of R0 will bring it above and below 1:1 is not sensible.

However, as someone on another side of the debate, I am frustrated by the once side-ness of this error correction.

Using synthetic data over the model to validate its capability is a good idea. However, this is not the first paper that failed this basic test. For example, the exact same idea has also been implemented to argue against Chernozhukov et al. (see the analysis [here(https://cspicenter.org/blog/waronscience/lockdowns-econometrics-and-the-art-of-putting-lipstick-on-a-pig/)). However, Chernozhukov et al. claimed benefits for NPIs and was never retracted.

This is despite Chernozhukov et al. being one of the best papers to claim that NPIs work. Flaxman et al, For example, is one of the more influential papers regarding the efficacy of NPIs, and its methodology is extremely, lets say, problematic.

The claim that lockdowns have absolutely *no* effect on the R value is clearly an extreme position (which some people do hold, nevertheless). On the other side, claiming that a few more weeks of lockdown would permanently eradicate covid is also clearly nonsense, as weve seen from the experiences of Australia and NZ with the Delta wave.

Between those extremes are a whole range of fuzzy questions:

* Do lockdowns actually save lives or just spread the deaths over a longer period of time?
* Are lockdowns a reasonable long-term strategy or just a temporary reprieve to roll out vaccinations or build more ventilators?
* Does a ""lockdown"" include voluntary actions by individuals following government advice and recommendations, or does it require strict legislation and enforcement?
* Do lockdowns promote or suppress the evolution of new variants (and are these variants more or less dangerous)?
* Are the negative effects of lockdowns greater or lesser in the long term than the damage done by the virus?

Depending on how you prioritise these various questions you will probably end up with a very different conclusion as to whether lockdowns can be said to ""work"".",0,think problem aspect debate defining exactly mean lockdown work non trivial the claim lockdown absolutely effect r value clearly extreme position people hold claiming week lockdown permanently eradicate covid clearly nonsense ve seen experience australia nz delta wave between extreme range fuzzy question lockdown actually save life spread death longer period time lockdown reasonable long term strategy temporary reprieve roll vaccination build ventilator lockdown include voluntary action individual following government advice recommendation require strict legislation enforcement lockdown promote suppress evolution new variant variant dangerous negative effect lockdown greater lesser long term damage virus depending prioritise question probably end different conclusion lockdown said work,neutral,0.98337239,desire,0.009833142,optimism,0.001169112

As for robust papers showing an effect, Flaxman or Chernozhukov are clearly not the most robust. I would consider Hsiang et al. (nature) and Brauner et al. (science) to be much more robust.

That being said, I dont deny that there are problematic papers on both end of the spectrum, but clearly the ones claiming no effect can only be bogus, because its obvious that NPIs would have an effect. The debate is in the size of th effect and on whether or not its worth it and for how long considering other parameters.

They tend to go that way over becoming more deadly as killing the host means the virus stops spreading. 

They think that the driving force behind this particular strain was someone with compromised immune system. The virus was presumably running rampant in her body. They treated her with monoclonal antibodies. That would have applied a selection pressure for changes to the spike protein, which probably explains why so there werso many spontaneous changes to the spike protein. Her crippled immune system wasnt enough to fully wipe the virus, however, so it kept mutating.

She was presumably in hospital. Id assume that the mutated virus ""escaped"" by infecting the medical staff. That would have again selected for the more virulent strains, able to more easily infect people in tiny quantities - despite distancing, PPE, and so on.

Is the strain as virulent as the government claim? Possibly, but also possibly not. Its possible that this strain had its growth accelerated by reaching the schools just as the same seasonal effects that cause the flu season took hold. Still, as the article says the evidence continues to point to the idea that this strain could be more contagious. 

Im not sure if anyone can say that the lockdown is at fault here. If allowed to run through the population then there would be even more opportunity fothe virus to mutate, including more opportunities for the virus to infect people with compromised immune systems.

Mass testing would be great. Theyve done some trials. My guess is that itll take a lot of test manufacturing as well as testing capacity. Its also a big logistical challenge, and could backfire...

Theres a truism that viruses tend to evolve to become less deadly and more infectious.

Its obvious that, all else being equal, a virus will gradually become as infectious as possible -- thats natural selection 101.

So, then: why would a virus become less deadly? The argument is that, once a host dies, it becomes incapable of spreading the virus that killed it; therefore, from an evolutionary perspective, a dead host is a bad host.

There are several problems with this, though. Most notably:

1. A virus could take a really long time to become less deadly. Variola major (smallpox) existed for *at least* thousands of years, and it had an estimated 30% mortality rate when it was eradicated.
2. A virus might not experience much selective pressure to become less deadly. This is the big one for COVID-19: current evidence suggests that people are most infectious just before they start showing symptoms, and that most people dont even have live virus in their systems around a week after symptoms appear. In other words, most people who die from COVID-19 already stopped spreading long ago.

However, if 1 year is lost on average for each of 20 million long-term job losses, that is 20 million “person years” of life lost, nearly 20 times as bad. Yes, many of these deaths will happen over an extended timeline, although some due to addiction, violence, and suicide are happening already. But still, this is a colossal loss of life, also tragic, let no one dispute it.

Not to mention the possibility that all these deaths many not be prevented, and instead just pushed into the near future.

The conclusions people come to with studies like this are flawed because we have not yet experienced the outcome of the pandemic or the second-order effects of the mitigation strategies used to prevent or delay deaths. Im concerned these types of early predictions will be used to justify further action by governments who may be underestimating the total burden these strategies place on a population.

> On average, implementation of any physical distancing intervention was associated with an overall reduction in covid-19 incidence of 13% (IRR 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.89; n=149 countries). 

So theyre saying that with lockdowns, the incidence goes from x to x*(1 - 0.13). Isnt that an absurdly small change? The USA has incidence >1000x that of Taiwan, and theyre talking about a 13% difference? Whats funny is that I simultaneous believe that (a) per below, this is scientifically meaningless econometric sludge that wouldnt have been published if not for the strong demand for something--anything--to justify the lockdowns in retrospect; and (b) its headline result grossly understates the benefits of lockdowns, because it lumped half-hearted ones with strict ones.

Perhaps the editors were relying on the public not to read past the title, not even to the abstract? That seems awfully cynical, but also seems to be exactly what has happened in this post. I think the editorial writers basically agree that the paper is awful, but cant quite bring themselves to say it. Quoting:

> Their results might be viewed in the same way as preliminary data used in grant applications: the evidence so far is suggestive of a particular conclusion but not good enough to rely on, so a more rigorous study is needed. The study’s conclusions are probably correct, but we cannot know this for certain from case data collected so unsystematically by countries around the world.

> Control strategies informed by flawed data might advance public health aims in the short term but do lasting damage to our ability to effect behavioral change through evidence in the future. We must be careful, then, not to mislead or overplay politically convenient findings and risk violating the public trust necessary for an effective pandemic response.


In any case, the paper authors basic methodology is that for each of 149 countries, they reduced all the interventions applied by that country to five types. They did a regression that concluded countries that applied more interventions sooner had lower incidence of coronavirus. But that coarse analysis has pretty weird consequences. Their summary table puts the American and Chinese (PRC) responses in the same category, since both applied all five types of intervention (somewhere, at some time). The intensity or geographic extent of the intervention is disregarded. Korea and Japan are actually in a less strict category (same as Sweden), because they never closed public transportation. And the regression makes no attempt to adjust for different degrees of underascertainment, which is clearly a huge factor when theyve included many small, low-income countries with minimal public health resources.

Its just generally bizarre that they included all these tiny countries. I couldnt find an explicit statement of whether they weighted equally or by population; but in the former case tiny populations have disproportionate effect, and in the latter theyre insignificant. In either case, the authors effort would have been better spent breaking big countries into sub-regions. And the only interventions studied are lockdown-type, so this fails to consider whether other factors (mask use, etc.) actually explain more of the difference. I dont see how anyone could believe such a grossly coarse methodology would yield any useful result; and returning to the policy question, I also dont believe that people advocating for lockdowns actually believe the effect on coronavirus incidence is just this papers claimed -13%.

To be clear, I believe the lockdowns were justified in some cases but not others, and that they carry both tremendous benefit in controlling the virus and tremendous social cost.

You probably couldn’t find enough people who would take money to not see their family for months at a time (assume staff would need to be quarantined on site for at least aw week before patient contact and then get testa before they are cleared to work?). And this needs to apply for *all* staff.
It’s likely possible in a few cases, or by moving staff that is ready to accept this together in specific facilities. But it’s not going to be a general solution that can be implemented in hundreds of care homes across a country.

Perhaps if you could find enough old care staff (nearing retirement age) they could agree to isolate with their patients. They likely don’t have kids they need to see and they benefit from isolation too.

What is possible is likely to isolate patients better, evacuate those with infection to special facilities, and avoid transferring those who recovered from hospital straight back to the home they came from.

I have to add also that I think just counting “deaths” are a crude measure. A 90year old person dying is not as bad as a 50 year old person by any way of measuring. That reasoning is not valuing one persons life over another. One already lives theirs. A 50 year old person could live another 30 years even with diabetes or hypertension. Looking at death stats and saying “30% happen in care homes!” might sound like we could improve the situation by 30% if we make  those deaths zero. But that’s too simplistic.

Two things should be optimized for: 1. minimizing suffering using some measure like quality adjusted life years lost. 2. Preventing an overwhelmed health care system. 

The 30% deaths in care homes might represent 5% of the years lost to the disease.

Deaths in elderly homes are unnecessary because they feel preventable. We can do better. No one should die that way, perhaps without any family around. But deaths in care homes don’t matter much for the two things any strategy should optimize for: life years lost and health care system strain (these patients almost never need ICU care and often aren’t even transported to hospital la if they are really fragile).",0,shortage staff probably couldn ’ t people money family month time assume staff need quarantined site aw week patient contact testa cleared work need apply staff it ’ s likely possible case moving staff ready accept specific facility it ’ s going general solution implemented hundred care home country perhaps old care staff nearing retirement age agree isolate patient likely don ’ t kid need benefit isolation what possible likely isolate patient better evacuate infection special facility avoid transferring recovered hospital straight home came i add think counting “ death ” crude measure 90year old person dying bad 50 year old person way measuring reasoning valuing person life life theirs 50 year old person live 30 year diabetes hypertension looking death stats saying “ 30 happen care home ! ” sound like improve situation 30 death zero that ’ s simplistic two thing optimized 1 minimizing suffering measure like quality adjusted life year lost 2 preventing overwhelmed health care the 30 death care home represent 5 year lost disease death elderly home unnecessary feel preventable better die way family death care home don ’ t matter thing strategy optimize life year lost health care strain patient need icu care aren ’ t transported hospital la fragile,neutral,0.997194171,optimism,0.000471201,approval,0.000443514

Do you honestly feel that nursing assistants at ALF’s would literally move in to the facility they work at? You’re of the belief that they don’t have families at home who are depending on them for care? They don’t have young children to care for, a home to maintain, or any other adult responsibilities? Sure there may be some who could just drop everything and move into a nursing facility but the large majority could not. 

Let’s also keep in mind that these facilities are becoming very difficult to staff as it is. A large number of nursing assistants have either gotten sick themself or quit out of fear of becoming sick. There isn’t a line of qualified people banging down the door to work in an ALF right now. Keeping the staff on premises would also increase their exposure and viral load making them more likely to become ill.

The mental strain placed on healthcare workers right now is off the charts. Anxiety, depression, and straight up fear. Staff need at least a brief chance to relax in a comforting place, take a long hot shower, maybe have a good cry, and recharge their batteries. Living IN the place that is causing this stress would surely limit their ability to recuperate and negatively affect the quality of care they are providing.

>Finally, we note that S&S would not be implemented in isolation. Measures such as contacting tracing (both traditional and app-based) could also facilitate exit from lockdown (Kucharski et al., 2020)

When people talk about segmentation and shielding high risk groups, we have found that this has been very hard even for countries who put in extra measures in place, like Sweden and nursing homes. We also know that nursing homes are not the only places where high risk individuals reside. In relation to the entire population of countries they are quite small.

>A key component of S&S is behavioural modification, not only for the vulnerable and shielder segments but also for the general population.

That is why a multi-pronged approach to exiting lockdowns will likely work best and that involves contact tracing.

>Extroverts may enjoy lower mortality than introverts under normal circumstances, but the relationship may be different during an airborne pandemic when social contact can be deadly. We used data for midlife Americans surveyed in 1995-96 with mortality follow-up through December 31, 2020 to investigate whether the association between extroversion and mortality changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that excess mortality during the pandemic will be greater for extroverts than for introverts. Results were based on a Cox model estimating age-specific mortality controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, the period trend in mortality, and an additional indicator for the pandemic period (Mar-Dec 2020). We interacted extroversion with the pandemic indicator to test whether the relationship differed between prepandemic and pandemic periods. Prior to the pandemic, extroversion was associated with somewhat lower mortality (HR=0.93 per SD, 95% CI 0.88-0.97), but the relationship reversed during the pandemic: extroverted individuals appeared to suffer higher mortality than their introverted counterparts, although the effect was not significant (HR=1.20 per SD, 95% CI 0.93-1.54). Extroversion was associated with greater pandemic related excess mortality (HR=1.20/0.93=1.29 per SD, 95% CI 1.00-1.67). Compared with someone who scored at the mean level of extroversion, mortality rates prior to the pandemic were 10% lower for a person who was very extroverted (i.e., top 12% of the sample at Wave 1), while they were 12% higher for someone who was very introverted (i.e., 11th percentile). In contrast, mortality rates during the pandemic appeared to be higher for very extroverted individuals (HR=1.15, 95% CI 0.77-1.71) and lower for those who were very introverted (HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.43-1.14) although the difference was not significant because of limited statistical power. In sum, the slight mortality advantage enjoyed by extroverts prior to the pandemic disappeared during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains to be seen whether that pattern continued into 2021-22. We suspect that the mortality benefit of introversion during the pandemic is largely a result of reduced exposure to the risk of infection, but it may also derive in part from the ability of introverts to adapt more easily to reduced social interaction without engaging in self-destructive behavior (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse).

Background

Spain is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological surveys are a valuable tool to assess the extent of the epidemic, given the existence of asymptomatic cases and little access to diagnostic tests. This nationwide population-based study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain at national and regional level.

Methods

35 883 households were selected from municipal rolls using two-stage random sampling stratified by province and municipality size, with all residents invited to participate. From April 27 to May 11, 2020, 61 075 participants (75·1% of all contacted individuals within selected households) answered a questionnaire on history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and risk factors, received a point-of-care antibody test, and, if agreed, donated a blood sample for additional testing with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Prevalences of IgG antibodies were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification to allow for differences in non-response rates based on age group, sex, and census-tract income. Using results for both tests, we calculated a seroprevalence range maximising either specificity (positive for both tests) or sensitivity (positive for either test).

Findings

Seroprevalence was 5·0% (95% CI 4·7–5·4) by the point-of-care test and 4·6% (4·3–5·0) by immunoassay, with a specificity–sensitivity range of 3·7% (3·3–4·0; both tests positive) to 6·2% (5·8–6·6; either test positive), with no differences by sex and lower seroprevalence in children younger than 10 years (<3·1% by the point-of-care test). There was substantial geographical variability, with higher prevalence around Madrid (>10%) and lower in coastal areas (<3%). Seroprevalence among 195 participants with positive PCR more than 14 days before the study visit ranged from 87·6% (81·1–92·1; both tests positive) to 91·8% (86·3–95·3; either test positive). In 7273 individuals with anosmia or at least three symptoms, seroprevalence ranged from 15·3% (13·8–16·8) to 19·3% (17·7–21·0). Around a third of seropositive participants were asymptomatic, ranging from 21·9% (19·1–24·9) to 35·8% (33·1–38·5). Only 19·5% (16·3–23·2) of symptomatic participants who were seropositive by both the point-of-care test and immunoassay reported a previous PCR test.

Interpretation

The majority of the Spanish population is seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in hotspot areas. Most PCR-confirmed cases have detectable antibodies, but a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 did not have a PCR test and at least a third of infections determined by serology were asymptomatic.

The answer might simply be that contact tracing isnt helping much, except in places like Korea or Taiwan that are finding a big share of the cases.

But since spread of the coronavirus seems to be very heterogeneous (i.e., a small subset of super-spreading patients accounts for most new cases), contact tracing may be effective even when it looks futile. Each person that a super-spreader infects is a chance to find them tracing back, so the contact tracers will naturally find the super-spreaders disproportionately. That means e.g. that even in Japan where theyre finding only ~20% of the cases, those cases might have been responsible for much more than 20% of the spread if they hadnt been found.

To be clear, Im not claiming that contact tracing is the major reason for Japans success; to the extent thats not just a mystery, Id give more weight to the masks and general hygiene.

If 60% of the population is recovered and immune, then only 40% remains susceptible, so only 40% of the events that would otherwise have spread the virus actually will. That means R is reduced to R0 * 0.4 = 2.5 * 0.4 = 1, and the epidemic stops growing. (The epidemic doesnt immediately disappear, though, and more people still get infected on the downslope. Epidemiologists call that ""overshoot"". Even if the epidemic ends due to herd immunity from recovered cases, death count will be reduced by slowing the spread enough to limit that overshoot.)

But the above assumes a homogeneous and well-mixed population, i.e. that each person has the same probability of becoming infected, and that the probability that you encounter a susceptible, infected or recovered person is independent of the probability that you yourself are susceptible, infected or recovered. For the reasons you list above, we know thats not true--people like medical workers have disproportionately high contacts, making them disproportionately likely to get infected first (with disproportionate harm), but then disproportionately likely to be immune later (with disproportionate benefit). The papers usually call that ""heterogeneity"" or ""dispersion"". This is near-certainly a big effect, but very little work exists to quantify it--the papers run the simulation assuming various degrees of heterogeneity, but those inputs are basically just guesses (except for one paper that used Bluetooth in a way similar to contact tracing apps to estimate that for a real cohort of college students, which I liked but which still maps uncertainly to behaviors that actually spread the coronavirus).

Id guess that public health authorities have typically given the 1 - 1/R0 = 60% because its an easy calculation, and because they consider even a gross overestimate to be prudent and conservative.

However now , months after a heavy lockdown which Spain NEEDED to do , the percentage of positive tests are going down , the number of cases while still present obviously is going down and deaths from around 800 a day in its peak , now Spain has days it goes without fatalities.  What Spain teaches the World is that testing and finding as many asymptomatic cases or minimally symptomatic cases is key to contain the outbreak. Obvioulsy testing has its logisitical limitations but every country or sub national jursidiction should do community based or pool testing as much as possible.

Now when you consider these hardest hit places and resulting low prevalence in societal outbreaks AND that the healthcare systems and societal infrastructures were overwhelmed in former and highly stressed in the latter, this pretty much gaurantees successive peaks in places that do not maintain interventions with each taking a systemic whack at your societal foundations degrading a societys ability to respond.  AND treatment and vaccines will come too late to mitigate the impact.

If you extrapolate, the first two maybe three peaks will hit the most vulnerable taking them out of the population and slowly a population will move toward herd immunity, however, it will not do so in a fashion that will sustain the core fabric of a society.  The movement toward herd immunity will be impacted by things we do not yet know. For example, IF immunity is shortlived as in months, this does not bode well for the future in the near to mid term (two years) to effective implementation of a vaccine. Further, vaccine may NOT be a complete solution as we do NOT know how effective they will be or what the initial uptake will be, both factors in herd immunity.

A country that is unable to get its population to, by consensus, agree to mitigation strategies and comply with them is in for big trouble. It may be time to let people know what the time frames are so they can psychologically prepare for, lets say, two years of this and what they dynamics will be so they can be prepared for partial lifting followed by re-instituted interventions.

A) Some significant number of people who are infected are not detectable with antibody testing. How big we dont know but its large. Its probably made worse that serological test are being verified with hospitalized patients when a vast majority of people are not. Mucosal and cell immumity is very real and its very possible a large percentage if it a majority are not mounting a humoral immune response at all.

B) We know for a FACT that our current serological tests are significantly missing a lot of prior infections. Similar to A) but we know that antibody levels fall below testing threshold quickly. How do we know this? Well smaller studies have show this but we have it confirmed. First we have two states Indiana and Rhode Island who dis randomized, state wide sero surveys. The data was wayyy too low. In Indianas case it actually showed the sero positive was less than 50% what previous PCR confirmed randomized infections the month prior. Rhode Islands found that 2.2% of their population was positive. The problem? That would mean that over the entire Spring RH had detected over 75% of their infections which is so ludicrous its beyond belief.


But we have another one. The UK was doing a large monitoring program where they were monitoring antibody levels. Well of course as more people got infected more people got antibodies. Duh.

Then the numbers started dropping. Antibodies are cumulative but soon after the infection was waning in the population the antibody monitoring suddenly started showing a smaller and smaller number of the population with antibodies. Thats not possible. The virus was still  circulating so the serosurvey shouldnt be going backwards UNLESS the test is missing a lot of prior positives as the antibodies fade.

Im still skeptical of all the ""Country XYZ is so-and-so many days behind Italy! Watch out!"" commentary that you primarily see flooding Twitter and other subs on Reddit.  Maybe Italy is just Italy, you know?

Also, the lockdown there did very little it seems.  Why would that be?  They cracked down hard over a week ago and nothing whatsoever is reflected in the current data.  I suspect it was far more widespread than anyone guessed and thats why new cases are still flooding in.  The virus is already virtually everywhere there.

I hope they are able to catch their breath, do some screening for antibodies, and determine that the disease totally ripped through already.

**Background**: 
Aetiology of preterm birth (PTB) is heterogeneous and preventive strategies remain elusive. Socio-environmental measures implemented as Ireland s prudent response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) pandemic represented, in effect, a national lockdown and have possibly influenced the health and wellbeing of pregnant women and unborn infants. Cumulative impact of such socio-environmental factors operating contemporaneously on PTB has never been assessed before.

 **Methods**:
 Regional PTB trends of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in one designated health area of Ireland over two decades were analysed. Poisson regression and rate ratio analyses with 95% CI were conducted. Observed regional data from January to April 2020 were compared to historical regional and national data and forecasted national figures for 2020. 

**Results**: 
Poisson regression analysis found that the regional historical VLBW rate per 1000 live births for January to April, 2001 to 2019 was 8.18 (95% CI: 7.21, 9.29). During January to April 2020, an unusually low VLBW rate of just 2.17 per 1000 live births was observed. **The rate ratio of 3.77 (95% CI: 1.21, 11.75), p = 0.022, estimates that for the last two decades there was, on average, 3.77 times the rate of VLBW, compared to the period January to April 2020 during which there is a 73% reduction.** National Irish VLBW rate for 2020 is forecasted to be reduced to 400 per 60,000 births compared to historical 500 to 600 range. 

**Conclusion**: **An unprecedented reduction in PTB of VLBW infants was observed in one health region of Ireland during the COVID-19 lockdown. Potential determinants of this unique temporal trend reside in the summative socio-environmental impact of the COVID-19 dictated lockdown.** Our findings, if mirrored in other regions that have adopted similar measures to combat the pandemic, demonstrate the potential to evaluate these implicated interdependent behavioural and socio-environmental modifiers to positively influence PTB rates globally",1,abstract background aetiology preterm birth ptb heterogeneous preventive strategy remain elusive socio environmental measure implemented ireland s prudent response sars cov 2 virus covid 19 pandemic represented effect national lockdown possibly influenced health wellbeing pregnant woman unborn infant cumulative impact socio environmental factor operating contemporaneously ptb assessed method regional ptb trend low birth weight vlbw infant designated health area ireland decade analysed poisson regression rate ratio analysis 95 ci conducted observed regional data january april 2020 compared historical regional national data forecasted national figure 2020 result poisson regression analysis regional historical vlbw rate 1000 live birth january april 2001 2019 8 18 95 ci 7 21 9 29 january april 2020 unusually low vlbw rate 2 17 1000 live birth observed rate ratio 3 77 95 ci 1 21 11 75 p = 0 022 estimate decade average 3 77 time rate vlbw compared period january april 2020 73 reduction national irish vlbw rate 2020 forecasted reduced 400 60 000 birth compared historical 500 600 range conclusion unprecedented reduction ptb vlbw infant observed health region ireland covid 19 lockdown potential determinant unique temporal trend reside summative socio environmental impact covid 19 dictated lockdown finding mirrored region adopted similar measure combat pandemic demonstrate potential evaluate implicated interdependent behavioural socio environmental modifier positively influence ptb rate globally,neutral,0.996269464,admiration,0.000544437,amusement,0.000530636

As a possible counterpoint to this idea, Table 1 shows that live births were up YoY. Wouldnt this phenomenon lower the rate of births per month? Of course, some ""would be preterm, now almost full term"" deliveries may have still occurred in this time frame. But more (most?) would have been pushed to later dates outside of this window of analysis. 

Its of course still possible that both can be true (this scenario is playing out, but there were many more people scheduled to deliver babies in this time over last year).",0,s interesting observation wondered vaguer term influenced kind risk benefit decision related pandemic mentioned preterm birth place range reason s driven mother s natural birthing process a possible counterpoint idea table 1 show live birth yoy wouldn t phenomenon lower rate birth month course preterm term delivery occurred time frame pushed later date outside window analysis it s course possible true scenario playing people scheduled deliver baby time year,excitement,0.538463473,surprise,0.333536565,neutral,0.041843977

It seems like an extreme over-complication of matters?

If you look at [figure 2  in ""REGIONAL SITUATION ASSESSMENT""(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/influenza-situation-assessment-18-December-2019.pdf) of the influenza virus from ECDC there is a yearly sharp uptick in cases around the beginning of December - exactly as we have seen it all over northern and central Europe in the last months.

I dont understand why there has to be such a surprise, and such elaborate modelling or scenario making to explain what looks *almost exactly* like the normal seasonal developments of seasonal influenza - especially when the sharp uptick is *not* exclusively seen in the UK but also in the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Denmark etc?

With this ""razor"" we can cut all the convoluted modelling and predict that the cases will keep rising and peak somewhere in week 4-9, just as we can retrospect with this perspective.

As a case take Denmark, they all have a ""sudden uptick"" somewhere in Q4, depending on severity of the season. In this case 2012/13 doesnt require much extrapolation.

1. Epidemiologically, this variant is showing up more and more in sequenced samples, and the S protein dropout on PCR is occurring more and more often.

3. One of the mutations affects the RBD, which could plausibly affect transmission and replication potential.

4. Patients with the variant show higher loads of viral RNA.  As some have pointed out, this doesnt necessarily mean that they are more contagious, but it is consistent with them being more contagious.

>Abstract  
>  
>The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a lockdown in many countries to control the exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This resulted in curbing the epidemic by reducing the time-varying basic reproduction number (Rt) to below one. Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a second peak in infections. More details on the specific circumstances that promote exponential spread (i.e. Rt>1) and the measures that contributed most to a reduction in Rt are needed. Here we show that in 33 of 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada), Rt fell to around or below one during lockdown (March - May 2020). One third of the effect happened already on average 6 days before the lockdown, with lockdown itself causing another major drop in transmission. Country-wide compulsory usage of masks was implemented only in Slovakia 10 days into lockdown, and on its own reduced transmission by half. During lockdown, decreased mobility in retail and recreation was an independent predictor of lower Rt during lockdown, while changes in other types of mobility were not. These results are consistent with anecdotal evidence that large recreational gatherings are super-spreading events, and may even suggest that infections during day-to-day contact at work are not sufficient to spark exponential growth. Our data suggest measures that will contribute to avoiding a second peak include a tight control on circumstances that facilitate massive spread such as large gatherings especially indoors, physical distancing, and mask use.

NOTES

The conclusions from this paper are not very surprising. People read the news, saw the rapidly rising numbers and sheltered-in-place to save their lives. However, it appears that in most instances these self-isolation would have been insufficient to suppress R = <1 and limit the spread of the epidemic in most of the areas accessed in this study.",1,abstract covid 19 pandemic prompted lockdown country control exponential spread sars cov 2 virus resulted curbing epidemic reducing time varying basic reproduction number rt government looking evidence balance demand citizen ease restriction fear second peak infection detail specific circumstance promote exponential spread e rt 1 measure contributed reduction rt needed 33 35 western country 32 european plus israel usa canada rt fell lockdown march 2020 effect happened average 6 day lockdown lockdown causing major drop transmission country wide compulsory usage mask implemented slovakia 10 day lockdown reduced transmission half lockdown decreased mobility retail recreation independent predictor lower rt lockdown change type mobility result consistent anecdotal evidence large recreational gathering super spreading event suggest infection day day contact work sufficient spark exponential growth data suggest measure contribute avoiding second peak include tight control circumstance facilitate massive spread large gathering especially indoors physical distancing mask use note the conclusion paper surprising people read news saw rapidly rising number sheltered place save life appears instance self isolation insufficient suppress r = 1 limit spread epidemic area accessed study,surprise,0.701925039,neutral,0.280349791,excitement,0.004678403

>Relatively little research has focused on children and young people (CYP) whose mental health and wellbeing improved during Covid-19 lockdown measures. We aimed to (1) determine the proportion of CYP who self-reported improvement in their mental wellbeing during the first Covid-19 lockdown and (2) describe the characteristics of this group in relation to their peers. We conducted a descriptive analysis of data from the 2020 OxWell Student Survey, a self-report, cross-sectional survey of English CYP. A total of 16,940 CYP primarily aged 8–18 years reported on change in mental wellbeing during lockdown. We characterised these CYP in terms of school, home, relational, and lifestyle factors as well as feelings about returning to school. One-third (33%) of CYP reported improved mental wellbeing during the first UK national lockdown. Compared with peers who reported no change or deterioration, a higher proportion of CYP with improved mental wellbeing reported improved relationships with friends and family, less loneliness and exclusion, reduced bullying, better management of school tasks, and more sleep and exercise during lockdown. In conclusion, a sizeable minority of CYP reported improved mental wellbeing during lockdown. Determining the reasons why these CYP felt they fared better during lockdown and considering how these beneficial experiences can be maintained beyond the pandemic might provide insights into how to promote the future mental health and wellbeing of school-aged CYP. All those working with CYP now have an opportunity to consider whether a systemic shift is needed in order to understand and realise any learnings from experiences during the pandemic.",1,abstract relatively little research focused child young people cyp mental health wellbeing improved covid 19 lockdown measure aimed 1 determine proportion cyp self reported improvement mental wellbeing covid 19 lockdown 2 characteristic group relation peer conducted descriptive analysis data 2020 oxwell student survey self report cross sectional survey english cyp total 16 940 cyp primarily aged 8–18 year reported change mental wellbeing lockdown characterised cyp term school home relational lifestyle factor feeling returning school 33 cyp reported improved mental wellbeing uk national lockdown compared peer reported change deterioration higher proportion cyp improved mental wellbeing reported improved relationship friend family loneliness exclusion reduced bullying better management school task sleep exercise lockdown conclusion sizeable minority cyp reported improved mental wellbeing lockdown determining reason cyp felt fared better lockdown considering beneficial experience maintained pandemic provide insight promote future mental health wellbeing school aged cyp working cyp opportunity consider systemic shift needed order understand realise learning experience pandemic,neutral,0.988573313,approval,0.005894282,optimism,0.001122345

Kids who had improved mental well-being over lockdown were those who had higher mental well-being (WEMWBS scores) and lower depression/anxiety anyway. Those who deteriorated, had the lowest well-being, and higher depression/anxiety.

>WEMWBS scores indicated that those who reported improved mental wellbeing during lockdown also had higher WEMWBS scores (median 53.0, IQR: 48.0; 58.0) than their peers who reported a deterioration (median 40.0, IQR: 34.0; 47.0) or no change (median 51.0, IQR: 45.0; 56.0). Those who reported improvement had lower levels of depression and anxiety (RCADS median 42.7, IQR: 36.1; 52.9) than their peers who reported deterioration (median 58.8, IQR: 48.1; 71.3) but were similar to their peers who reported no change (median 42.5, IQR: 35.6; 51.8).

The sample is also heavily stilted towards richer schools. National free school meal rate is about 17% - in this sample, its 7.5%. 70% of schools are in the lower 5 deciles of deprivation.

To me, its interesting to investigate the reasons why children felt they had better mental health during lockdown, but (and the authors do discuss this) its important not to get carried away with what this shows.

It assumed people would hear about this stuff on the news and just continue to go to concerts, kiss their Nan, sloppily make out with strangers in bars, pick their nose in the office when no one is looking, skip out on washing their hands in the bathroom, and all the other normal activities that contribute to a sky-high R0 in a given population.

Obviously it was never going to spread that much. You almost never (possibly actually never) see infectious diseases infecting enough of the population to get to herd immunity, even in animal populations that obviously have zero concept of germ theory. People catch on and alter behavior. There is background immunity from other diseases with similar epitopes (i.e. other coronaviruses). There are populations that have a reduced susceptibility to the disease. Honestly, I wouldnt be shocked if NYC never has another clear ""peak"" in infections because there is so much mitigating it. I wouldnt be surprised if we never see a large peak in much of rural America. Id imagine our healthcare resources will never be overwhelmed to the extent of NYC anywhere in the country.

I study cancer immunotherapy, so this stuff is new to me, but the more I learn even basic principles of epidemiology the more I am shocked at the widespread acceptance of those predictions. The Spanish flu infected 28% of the US by most estimates. On the one hand, we are more crowded and more mobile, on the other, we have far better dissemination of news, wide-spread disinfectant supply, default public health practices (e.g. hand washing, capacity limits), ability to alter supply chains/sanitary practices, increased capacity to expand the volume of care given, antibody tests to identify those who are immune, etc...

Everyone on both extremes (which has unfortunately broken down into left vs. right in the US) has got this wrong. Opening up the economy will probably not save your struggling non-essential small business, but it might reduce the amount of aid necessary to keep you afloat substantially. Closing down the economy is not the only thing keeping this disease from ravaging the entire world.

The time to release the lockdown is when the net benefits of doing so become positive.

1.The net benefits include many items, some positive and some negative, and their size varies over time.

On the positive side, releasing the lockdown

1. increases people’s incomes now and in the future.
2. reduces unemployment now and in the future.
3. improves mental health, suicide, domestic violence, addiction, and loneliness.
4. maintains confidence in the government.
5. restores schooling. As time progresses, the positive effects will increase in magnitude.

On the negative side, releasing the lockdown

1. increases the final number of deaths from the virus (as well as from other conditions which may get undertreated if health services become overstretched with COVID-19 patients).
2. increases road-deaths, commuting, CO2 emissions, and air pollution.

2.To compare the different effects requires a common metric. We propose as a metric the number of Wellbeing Years (WELLBYs). This metric is analogous to the QALY metric which has been successfully used in the NHS for 20 years. It should now be extended to all fields of public policy.

3.In this paper we show how the WELLBY metric can provide a framework for evaluating the net benefits of releasing the lockdown in the UK month-by-month, applying the WELLBY metric to each type of effect. The net benefits rise steadily as the lockdown proceeds, since the positive items increase in magnitude.
