1. We didnt KNOW it was overblown at the beginning. Hell, I remember seeing videos of people dying in the streets in China and Iran and was told *from the same conspiracy people  you see at these rallies* that it was 10x worse than the ""media"" was portraying it as. Obviously that didnt happen in major 1st world nations, but we still had NO idea what we were dealing with at the start. The overreaction is justified when you are faced with a novel pathogen and no time to study it, despite it actively spreading.
2. We know more now. The lockdowns are largely over. What weve finally arrived at (after a lot of debate, because again, we had little information to go off of), is that life can return, but it must be done with precautions to reduce transmission while we wait for viable treatments or simply let the science catch up to itself once we have more stats on how it effects people. Ergo, masks and distancing (when possible).

But no...these same people dont want that, either. They want life to continue unabated, even though they are simply not qualified to make that judgement call for the whole of society. They think it should just burn through the population so we can reach ""herd immunity"", despite that being something that has ONLY been achieved via a vaccine. In other pandemics prior, it simply caused a massive, massive death toll. **They are selfish pricks, who (ironically) would be the first to rush to the hospital if they or someone they loved was experiencing a severe case of COVID19.**

The response to the rapid virus spread has been flawed; humans in general are flawed and mistakes are always made at every level of leadership for just about every issue we have faced. But that doesnt mean it was intentional, diabolical or malicious. And it doesnt mean that we should revert to ""normal life"" when it hasnt even been a full year of studying the new virus within the human body.",0,agree couple point 1 t know overblown beginning hell remember seeing video people dying street china iran told conspiracy people rally 10x worse medium portraying obviously t happen major 1st world nation idea dealing start overreaction justified faced novel pathogen time study despite actively spreading 2 know lockdown largely ve finally arrived lot debate little information life return precaution reduce transmission wait viable treatment simply let science catch stats effect people ergo mask distancing possible but people t want want life continue unabated simply qualified judgement society think burn population reach herd immunity despite achieved vaccine pandemic prior simply caused massive massive death toll selfish prick ironically rush hospital loved experiencing severe case covid19 the response rapid virus spread flawed human general flawed mistake level leadership issue faced t mean intentional diabolical malicious t mean revert normal life hasn t year studying new virus human body,fear,0.93836987,neutral,0.035508934,sadness,0.006561181

New cases? All other scandinavian countries tested more, up to 4x what sweden did. Still sweden has more infections. Wondering if it is really flattening the curve or it is just a test amount limit.
Deaths? Many times more deaths compared to the other scandinavian countries. With constant lags since months.
ICU not being full? Partly true but also due to not admitting elderly patients as reported by swedish sources. Again no other scandinavian country had the healthcare system overwhelmed.
Economy? Not doing so different than other scandinavian countries. Will be interesting to see when others will reopen borders if they will include sweden. If not.. that is not going to help the swedish economy.
Herd immunity? Being moved forward on a biweekly base since 2 months. Still none knows how long the antibodies will last. If they last a few months the entire concept would make no sense.
Protecting the elderly? They admitted this is not working as expected.
Better protection for second wave? Assuming the antibodies will still be effective the other countries are not just waiting for the second wave to happen. They already got extra beds ready, they have massive testing in place, they are starting general screenings, they have isolation plans, they have tools to perform constant monitoring, ventilatora and PPE supplies are good.

So there is no indicator at all that the plan is good compared to the other scandinavian countries, countries that are closer to sweden not only on the world map but also culturally (more social distancing) and in density and area.

Then if daily numbers are not what they like they say they are just a little off and anyhow if you are not born and raised in sweden and live there you are stupid by definition and cannot understand this amazing plan.

The only people that say they are doing good are those with no basic math knowledge or they are just defending some kind of mass murder.

For them density is not crucial in the spread of a disease.
For them comparing the absolute number of deaths is normal so they are doing great conpared to a country with 33 times the population.

Sorry for the long post. TLDR: The metric used is more complex than any single number, and the strategy is long-term.

First: Swedens approach is more holistic, not looking at only the spread of the virus, but also at things like mental health, domestic violence, childrens education, vitamin D deficiency (a real problem every early spring!), etc, etc... If a harder lock-down could have prevented an additional 1000 deaths, but at the additional cost of 100 women beaten by their husbands, 10,000 children falling behind in school, and 10,000 jobs lost, is it the right choice to make? There is no right answer of course, but there is a wrong one: ignoring everything except the death rate is not right. Yet its what everyone always seems to do in these discussions. The decision to keep elementary schools open came from this, since we dont want a ""lost generation"" of schoolchildren too young to learn effectively on-line.

Second: Swedens strategy is *significantly* more long-term than any other countrys. While other countries have set dates for when they will open their countries back up, and then pushed those dates forward, Sweden have said from the start that their measures may have to stay in place until mass vaccination is complete *in 2-5 years time*. What will happen when countries open back up? Germany saw their R-number rise above 1.0 again, and had to partially backtrack, for instance. This will not happen to Sweden, since we arent planning on lifting the restrictions.

Some governments are hoping that Test, Trace, and Isolate (TTI) will prevent a second wave, but we seem to forget that we were doing TTI before the first wave! All through late January and February, most European countries (with the notable exception of the UK) did contact tracing of their Covid cases, but were unable to stop the wave from materializing. Sure, weve learned more since then, but can we really be confident that a second wave wont happen?

Third: The strategy is working! The death rate is currently half of what it was at its peak! Our ICUs have never been full (and no, old people were *not* being denied intensive care any more than they normally are, except for a few individual cases at one hospital, which is being investigated). We have had fewer deaths per capita than Belgium, Spain, Italy, the UK, France, New York State, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and are about to be overtaken by several US states, the US as a whole, Russia, and probably Brazil. I dont really understand why people seem so eager to complain at Sweden, when we are arguably doing better than many other countries.

Also, there is a lot of misinformation going around. Since herd immunity isnt, and has never been, the goal of the Swedish strategy, having to push the herd immunity date forward is not a failure. Its actually a success, since it means that you were better at preventing people from catching the disease than you thought you were going to be. Also, a lot of people seem to think that Swedens strategy is to do nothing except issue vague recommendations, which is absolutely not the case. There are strict rules *as well as* recommendations, and there are businesses that have been fined and shut down for breaking those rules.

You are right in one thing tough: The lack of adequate tests is a failure. And the government have admitted this, saying that they havent reached the testing targets they sought. Also, that the disease was allowed to spread into our nursing homes is a tragedy, and this has also been admitted by the government. It seems to have happened because we lacked a strategic emergency supply of PPE beforehand, which Ill gladly admit is extremely dumb.",0,support strategy ll explain sorry long post tldr metric complex single number strategy long term first sweden s approach holistic looking spread virus thing like mental health domestic violence child s education vitamin d deficiency real problem early spring ! harder lock prevented additional 1000 death additional cost 100 woman beaten husband 10 000 child falling school 10 000 job lost right choice right answer course wrong ignoring death rate right s discussion decision elementary school open came t want lost generation schoolchildren young learn effectively line second sweden s strategy significantly long term country s country set date open country pushed date forward sweden said start measure stay place mass vaccination complete 2 5 year time happen country open germany saw r number rise 1 0 partially backtrack instance happen sweden aren t planning lifting restriction some government hoping test trace isolate tti prevent second wave forget tti wave ! late january february european country notable exception uk contact tracing covid case unable stop wave materializing sure ve learned confident second wave won t happen third strategy working ! death rate currently half peak ! icu old people denied intensive care normally individual case hospital investigated fewer death caput belgium spain italy uk france new york state new jersey massachusetts overtaken state russia probably brazil t understand people eager complain sweden arguably better country also lot misinformation going herd immunity isn t goal swedish strategy having push herd immunity date forward failure s actually success mean better preventing people catching disease thought going lot people think sweden s strategy issue vague recommendation absolutely case strict rule recommendation business fined shut breaking rule you right thing tough lack adequate test failure government admitted saying haven t reached testing target sought disease allowed spread nursing home tragedy admitted government happened lacked strategic emergency supply ppe ll gladly admit extremely dumb,amusement,0.567561388,neutral,0.284179211,remorse,0.090490274

They might as well have said that their plan was to do nothing, because thats what it was.

>This observational study, using a generalized phenomenological method based on official daily deaths records only, shows that full lockdown policies of France, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom haven’t had the expected effects in the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. Our results show a general decay trend in the growth rates and reproduction numbers two to three weeks before the full lockdown policies would be expected to have visible effects. Comparison of pre and post lockdown observations reveals a counter-intuitive slowdown in the decay of the epidemic after lockdown. **Estimates of daily and total deaths numbers using pre-lockdown trends suggest that no lives were saved by this strategy, in comparison with pre-lockdown, less restrictive, social distancing policies.** Comparison of the epidemic’s evolution between the fully locked down countries and neighboring countries applying social distancing measures only, confirms the absence of any effects of home containment

Turns out full lockdowns are actually kind of useless related to preventing deaths. Because your inmune system doesnt watch the news to see if everyone is lock down, and then it mounts a defense. Once you get the virus, the outcomes are independant of whatever the fuck society is doing, except hospital overload.

Sweden is doing statistical representative testning to come to accurate infection numbers.

>Many times more deaths compared to the other scandinavian countries. With constant lags since months.

A large part of the deaths are found in eldercare homes, and are people which would have died in the same period regardless. There is no statistical significant amount of extra death compared to other years. The difference between Sweden and Denmark/Norway may as well have to do with different ways of counting deaths. If there were errors done in the eldercare (I havent heard anything as crazy, as New York & Michigan putting Corona patients in elder care homes), then that is unfortunate, but unlikely it had anything to do with the Swedish Corona strategy. Sweden closed elder homes for visitors before Denmark did.

>The only people that say they are doing good are those with no basic math knowledge or they are just defending some kind of mass murder.

You forgot to mention the local diversity when comparing the Scandinavian countries. For example, the capital region of Denmark and the neighboring Swedish Region ""Skåne"" have roughly the same size of population, same geography, and are connected by a bridge that is locked down from the danish side. So not a whole lot of mixing between the two regions. The death rate on the Danish side - who chooses the lockdown strategy, is more than 3 times higher than the Swedish region.  


Why didnt you mention that in your facts?  


Regarding economy you dont mention public spending. Interesting regarding the Scandinavian countries have a very large public part of their economy covered by public spending. The latest study shows that Denmark has spent 2 billion Swedish kronor more per day compared to Sweden since the virus started. With this going on for a couple of months so far, it adds up. And since European countries dont adhere to the American ""just print more money"" strategy, those billions will have to be collected somehow in the future.  


Regarding opening up the borders, you speculate if Scandinavian countries will open up their borders to Sweden. Maybe you are not European and dont understand the concept of the EU, but very simplified they dont have much choice. And tell me, why would Denmark not open their borders to Sweden when the only regions with borders is Skåne with one-third of the deaths the danish side of the borders have? Shouldnt it be Sweden closing those borders to Denmark?

You have to get infected first in order to get antibodies, unless theres a vaccine. Why dont people get this? All this infect-young-to-protect-elderly bs dont work unless elderly are perfectly quarantined until all youngsters get it and develop antibodies. Not gonna happen.

Whats gonna happen is this. Infected will either 1) die 2) spread disease 3) stay in isolation until  he/she can no longer spread disease(has antibody). Most likely route is #2. So thats like, doing nothing, because thats whats most likely going to happen when you do nothing.

The best, and the only right way is test-track-isolate. Other measures, whatever they are, are second best at most. By this measure Sweden isnt doing great at all.

You can’t call people selfish murderers for wanting to see their family, but then also applaud and belittle this guys death

Yes he did die, but what it seems like you dont understand is that he didnt die by himself, his actions of rallying people to oppose lockdowns because it infringes on personal freedom, caused the death of others who may not even have been at those rallies. The article notes that most people in those rallies did not practice proper social distancing or mask wearing. And if the top leaders of the rally are doing this because they dont believe the virus exists or they are acting on selfish reasons (cant wait a couple of months to see their families ) and 90% are doing it because they are for the ""right"" reasons (what exactly are those right reasons according to you?), the fact still stands that they are putting themselves and their reasons first over the overall health and safety of the greater community. 

So shame on you for trying to shame this community for feeling a bit of resentment and vindictiveness over those who willingly put other peoples lives at risk for their feeling of personal freedom, financial strain, or because they want to see their families and cant wait a few months. You do know these are all peoples individual choices. People are saying what about the people who are losing their businesses? Well you know what, owning a business is risky. My family has owned businesses and struggled because of it, and now we arent in the industry anymore and moved on. People can choose to wait respectfully and patiently or throw a tantrum and demand to get what they want. The innocent people who have been infected and died because of these peoples actions are not a choice. Their deaths have been caused by other peoples selfish actions.  Yes peoples pains are relative but when choosing between personal/ financial pain, and actual death and the death of others, I have less compassion for the first.",0,died regardless shared belief it ’ s tragedy can ’ t people selfish murderer wanting family applaud belittle guy death yes die like t understand t die action rallying people oppose lockdown infringes personal freedom caused death rally article note people rally practice proper social distancing mask wearing leader rally t believe virus exists acting selfish reason t wait couple month family 90 right reason exactly right reason according fact stand putting reason overall health safety greater community so shame trying shame community feeling bit resentment vindictiveness willingly people s life risk feeling personal freedom financial strain want family t wait month know people s individual choice people saying people losing business know owning business risky family owned business struggled aren t industry anymore moved people choose wait respectfully patiently throw tantrum demand want innocent people infected died people s action choice death caused people s selfish action yes people s pain relative choosing personal financial pain actual death death compassion,sadness,0.94223541,neutral,0.018305041,anger,0.009889319

It would be fine if it was a debate article, but news reporting is supposed to be objective and neutral.

It also both contains false/misleading information and tries to disguise opinions as facts. For example, Sweden has not asked any of its neighbours for help (although they have been generous enough to offer help).

Also, the part of ""leaving the citizens to decide for themselves whether to socially distance or not"" is not correct. Yes, Swedens approach has been more voluntary and less enforced than other countries. But the guidelines have been very clear on this point since Spring - do not attend unnecessary gatherings, work from home whenever possible, keep distance and all that. And it has not only been voluntary. High schools and universities have been closed, and public gatherings have been limited. There are strict rules for restaurants and bars, and those who are not complying are closed.

The way that Sweden has been lambasted or praised in the media regarding their lockdown stance is one of the hugest propaganda campaigns Ive ever had the misfortune to witness. It should be highly obvious by now that just having a lockdown does not guarantee COVID will be managed over the long-term. It is far more prudent to compare Swedens no-lockdown response with other countries that didnt use internal lockdowns like Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Finland, and Iceland. The idea that only internal lockdowns can stop COVID is a fabrication not supported by reality, but its not a stance Im surprised to see taken by an Australian journalist.

While everyone loves to compare Sweden to their neighbors Norway and Denmark, no one seems to be able to say what those countries actually did differently other than locking down, which Denmark just recently had to do again. Even so, given that the other Nordic nations are handling themselves well currently, it isnt only Sweden that needs to take note but the rest of the EU as well!",1,sweden s failure far lockdown single mistake ve s sweden actually failed secure nursing home vulnerable spot enacted strong border closure waited late create pandemic crisis law discouraged usage mask run mass testing campaign encourage testing quarantine traveler isolating confirmed covid patient x200b the way sweden lambasted praised medium lockdown stance hugest propaganda campaign ve misfortune witness highly obvious having lockdown guarantee covid managed long term far prudent compare sweden s lockdown response country t use internal lockdown like taiwan south korea japan finland iceland idea internal lockdown stop covid fabrication supported reality s stance m surprised taken australian journalist while love compare sweden neighbor norway denmark able country actually differently locking denmark recently given nordic nation handling currently isn t sweden need note rest eu well !,neutral,0.986246586,surprise,0.006444083,realization,0.00311285

That sounds a bit like a strawman argument. No one is claiming just having a lockdown is enough, however it should be obvious by now that it is part of the response, and would have help Sweden significantly. For example, the fact that they did not close bars, cafes and hair salons for a very long time certainly did not help, as those proved to be important contagion sites.",0,highly obvious having lockdown guarantee covid that sound bit like strawman argument claiming having lockdown obvious response help sweden significantly example fact close bar cafe hair salon long time certainly help proved important contagion site,optimism,0.736344099,neutral,0.190977648,approval,0.052238096

Sweden has had good tools at its disposal, at least during the second wave. A rich country with high trust in authorities, well-established infrastructure to make working from home and distance teaching easy, and a very low rate of inter-generational homes. Had the response been more proactive and maybe a tad stricter, I think a lot of needless deaths couldve been avoided.

And yes, there are actual restrictions as well:

* Closing of universities and high schools
* Public gatherings limited to 8 people
* Rules for restaurants and bars (including limiting parties to 4 people, no alcohol after 20:00, distance between tables etc)

And more may be coming as well, once the new pandemic law gives the government more legal authority to enact restrictions (from mid January).

Yes it was because some stupid decisions about nursing homes (so let me head you off there) but it was also because therapeutics weren’t there, knowledge about ventilator delay in improved outcomes, and the fact that no one was wearing masks or practice much precautions at all in the early days (except the pacific NW what had comparatively great outcomes). Basically if you look at the highest deaths per million it’s a good portion of northeast and Louisiana (all first wave victims) and those deaths are frontloaded.  

What I care about NOW is what we are doing NOW because that will determine what the next 5 weeks look like.  If you make stupid decisions in ignorance back then we’ll yeah then that sucks.   But If you make stupid decisions NOW when you know better than you are willfully messed up.  Every day choices today make specific realities play out for the next 5 weeks.  We have no reason to think that masks aren’t a helpful tool. Here is my experience. 

In my context at work we had someone come in and I made him wear a mask (it’s mandated in our state).   In the course of 2 hours he interacted and sat with with a total of 35 people throughout his visit (different work cohorts).  He wore a mask except when he was with one group of 6 people.   They all sat across (sort of distanced) from eachother like the others but at this meeting they had coffee and pastries (which the kind of weren’t supposed to do in a group context but they did) so they all took their masks off for what we think was 20-30 minutes.  

2 days later he called me and said he was sick and lost his smell.   He tested positive for Covid that day with a rapid test. After notifying everyone and having them quarantine only 4 got sick.  They were all the ones who had coffee and pastries.   One was hospitalized but eventually recovered after 2 weeks in the hospital and another week or so of supplemental oxygen. 

No matter what way we want to slice it our actions will shape the next 5 weeks and the overall trajectory of this thing.   Draw a line in the curves and numbers after the lockdowns ended.

Swedens previous chief epidemiologist was Johan Giesecke.  Giesecke hired Tegnell.  

Three weeks ago, Giesecke did a half hour youtube interview where he states the reaction to covid-19 is due to hysteria and that it is a mild illness that will ultimately have a fatality rate of 0.1%.   

I found it astonishing because even at that time, the death rate in New York City had exceeded 0.1% and only twenty or thirty percent were testing positive for antibodies.  I still dont understand the rationale in Sweden.

>\- The Imperial College paper was “not very good” and he has never seen  an unpublished paper have so much policy impact   
>  
>\- The paper was very much too pessimistic   
>  
>\- Any such models are a dubious basis for public policy anyway   
>  
>\- The flattening of the curve is due to the most vulnerable dying first  as much as the lockdown   
>  
>\- The results will eventually be similar for all countries   
>  
>\- Covid-19 is a “mild disease” and similar to the flu, and it was the  novelty of the disease that scared people.   
>  
>\- The actual fatality rate of Covid-19 is the region of 0.1%

Abstract  
This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 deniers on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany. In a first step, we establish a link between regional proxies of COVID-19 deniers and infection rates. We then estimate the causal impact of large anti-lockdown protests on the spread of COVID-19 using an event study framework. Employing novel data on bus stops of travel companies specialized in driving protesters to these gatherings, and exploiting the timing of two large-scale demonstrations in November 2020, we find sizable increases in infection rates in protesters origin regions after these demonstrations. Individual-level evidence supports the main results by documenting that COVID-19 deniers engage less in health protection behavior. Our results contribute to the debate about the public health costs of individual behavior that has detrimental externalities for the society.",1,spreading disease protest time pandemic martin lange ole monscheuer zew mannheim humboldt university berlin february 8 2021 abstract this study analyzes impact covid 19 denier spread covid 19 germany step establish link regional proxy covid 19 denier infection rate estimate causal impact large anti lockdown protest spread covid 19 event study framework employing novel data bus stop travel company specialized driving protester gathering exploiting timing large scale demonstration november 2020 sizable increase infection rate protester origin region demonstration individual level evidence support main result documenting covid 19 denier engage health protection behavior result contribute debate public health cost individual behavior detrimental externality society,amusement,0.996944129,neutral,0.001070847,approval,0.000317462

Though the boundary conditions of their model is extremely limited. For instance, there have been protests at other times over the past year. While their model works excellently for data within a \~20 day bound, if you use the same model for any other month, it will fail dramatically. 

The same model offers nothing and makes counter predictions for protests in early August, late September of 2020. Also it would have a negative correlation if done with protests since the turn of the year. 

All of this leaving aside leaps of moralization. While I praise their vehement efforts, their claims of causality are static and not dynamic. Thus they fail to demonstrate the sufficiency pillar of causality. 

Also, their mechanistic claims of transmission are unfounded, outdoor spread of covid-19 is negligible and marginal. No wonder they find that protests account for less than 5% of increase in (only) cumulative case counts, if at all. This slight variation can be explained by increased testing after culmination of travel either based on choice or mandated. Nevertheless, such a marginal increase only in counts cannot be shielded from intervening variables.",0,cool stuff though boundary condition model extremely limited instance protest time past year model work excellently data 20 day bound use model month fail dramatically the model offer make counter prediction protest early august late september 2020 negative correlation protest turn year all leaving aside leap moralization praise vehement effort claim causality static dynamic fail demonstrate sufficiency pillar causality also mechanistic claim transmission unfounded outdoor spread covid 19 negligible marginal wonder protest account 5 increase cumulative case count slight variation explained increased testing culmination travel based choice mandated marginal increase count shielded intervening variable,approval,0.979591548,neutral,0.007850447,admiration,0.005754522

Researchers have come to the conclusion that the anti-lockdown demonstrations in Leipzig and Berlin in November were superspreader events for all of Germany.

On this November day, people push their way through the center of Leipzig, mostly without any distance or mask. Many of the so-called “lateral thinkers” (Querdenker) make themselves comfortable on picnic blankets and folding chairs in the middle of the streets, the central Augustusplatz is not big enough for the crowd. The police lost control. Police officers ended a demonstration with 20,000 to 40,000 people, but hours later thousands of demonstrators march unhindered through the city.

A similar picture emerges a few days later in Berlin. Opponents of the corona measures want to prevent the new infection protection law in the government quarter on November 18. Stones, bottles and firecrackers fly - 77 police officers are injured. Water cannons drive up in front of the Brandenburg Gate.

Here, too, the mixture of “lateral thinkers” and other conspiracy ideologues, as well as esotericists, right-wing extremists, citizens of the Reich and general critics of the corona policy do not adhere to the obligation to wear mouth and nose protection or to keep their distance. The police dissolve the gathering of 5,000 to 9,000 people after three hours and dozens of warnings, and the eviction lasts until the evening.

It is now clear that these two anti-lockdowns demonstrations were Corona Superspreader events. Had the rallies been canceled, between 16,000 and 21,000 Covid-19 infections could have been prevented by Christmas.

This is the result of a current study by ZEW Mannheim and the Humboldt University in Berlin. The scientists examined how the seven-day incidence has developed in districts with a high proportion of corona deniers.

Three factors were superimposed: The proportion of AfD voters in an area, as the party consistently denies the dangers of the virus. These were compared with the measles vaccination rate at the district level and with the bus stops of the ""Honk for Hope"" network.

Many lateral thinkers (Querdenker) use the buses of the network of the self-styled Corona critic Thomas Kaden to come to demonstrations from all over Germany. This bus network differs significantly from the lines of comparable bus operators. ""Honk for Hope"" stops all over Germany, but many smaller cities are also served. One focus is in the south of Saxony, in the north of Bavaria and in the east of Thuringia.

With these factors, the authors of the study come to the conclusion that after the two demonstrations in Leipzig and Berlin, the seven-day incidence increased significantly more in districts in which there are cities served by the “Honk for Hope” network.

Compared to counties without stops, it was around 40 higher on average until Christmas. For example, if the incidence rose from 60 to 100 in city A without a stop, it rose from 60 to 140 in the same period in city B with a stop.

""We see in our data that ten to twelve days after the demonstrations that the incidence in the bus stop counties is increasing sharply,"" says study author Martin Lange to Tagesspiegel. ""Because there were even more people in Leipzig than in Berlin, we assume that the Leipzig demonstration also had the greater effect on the number of infections.""

Lange does not want to single out individual districts by name on the phone. But it is clearly recognizable that the incidence is increasing more strongly, especially in small towns with such a bus stop. “We interpret this to mean that a place that is quite small, but still has a bus stop like this, must have a particularly high proportion of corona denier demonstration participants and it is therefore also plausible that the infection numbers there increased after the demonstrations, ” explains Lange.",1,modified machine translation researcher come conclusion anti lockdown demonstration leipzig berlin november superspreader event germany on november day people push way center leipzig distance mask called “ lateral thinker ” querdenker comfortable picnic blanket folding chair middle street central augustusplatz big crowd police lost control police officer ended demonstration 20 000 40 000 people hour later thousand demonstrator march unhindered city a similar picture emerges day later berlin opponent corona measure want prevent new infection protection law government quarter november 18 stone bottle firecracker fly 77 police officer injured water cannon drive brandenburg gate here mixture “ lateral thinker ” conspiracy ideologue esotericists right wing extremist citizen reich general critic corona policy adhere obligation wear mouth nose protection distance police dissolve gathering 5 000 9 000 people hour dozen warning eviction last evening it clear anti lockdown demonstration corona superspreader event rally canceled 16 000 21 000 covid 19 infection prevented christmas this result current study zew mannheim humboldt university berlin scientist examined seven day incidence developed district high proportion corona denier three factor superimposed proportion afd voter area party consistently denies danger virus compared measles vaccination rate district level bus stop honk hope network many lateral thinker querdenker use bus network self styled corona critic thomas kaden come demonstration germany bus network differs significantly line comparable bus operator honk hope stop germany smaller city served focus south saxony north bavaria east thuringia with factor author study come conclusion demonstration leipzig berlin seven day incidence increased significantly district city served “ honk hope ” network compared county stop 40 higher average christmas example incidence rose 60 100 city stop rose 60 140 period city b stop data day demonstration incidence bus stop county increasing sharply say study author martin lange tagesspiegel people leipzig berlin assume leipzig demonstration greater effect number infection lange want single individual district phone clearly recognizable incidence increasing strongly especially small town bus stop “ we interpret mean place small bus stop like particularly high proportion corona denier demonstration participant plausible infection number increased demonstration ” explains lange,amusement,0.995554626,neutral,0.00140517,approval,0.000784689

The protests playing out now have the same feel as the Tea Party protests aided by Koch-financed Americans for Prosperity and others a decade ago — and with good reason: Early evidence suggests they are not organic but a brush fire being stoked by some of the same people and money that built the Tea Party.

Look no further than the first protest organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition and the Michigan Freedom Fund — whose chairman manages the vast financial investments of Dick and Betsy DeVos, the Education Secretary — to see that the campaign to “open” America flows from the superrich and their front groups.

Stephen Moore — a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Koch ally and a Trump adviser — admitted as much in a video I obtained comparing these new protesters to Rosa Parks, as first reported in The Times.

Mr. Moore, who is now leading an enterprise to end the virus precautions called Save Our Country, which includes the Koch-backed American Legislative Exchange Council, boasted that he has been working behind the scenes with a conservative donor who agreed to cover bail and legal fees for demonstrators who get arrested for defying Wisconsin’s virus protective measures.

Others are providing legal assistance as well. The Times reports that a private Facebook group called Reopen NC has retained the legal services of Michael Best & Friedrich, a Wisconsin law firm whose clients include President Trump. The firm is well known for its work with dark-money groups that fought the recall of the Koch ally Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and waged war on unions.

Then there’s the Convention of States, established in 2015 with a big contribution from the conservative hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. The group recruits activists at gun shows to support a balanced-budget amendment and is promoting the protests online via “Open the States.” COS is an offshoot of Citizens for Self-Governance, which Mr. Meckler co-founded with a longtime Koch operative, Eric O’Keefe.

To give you a flavor of what’s unfolding to help orchestrate these events, this week one of Mr. Meckler’s organizers told supporters via Facebook that “optics are everything” and that they should be sure to wear a mask to the protests and stand six feet apart — because it will make the crowds look bigger.

COS and a Koch-financed public relations firm, In Pursuit Of, are also purchasing domain names tied to protests to open the states, suggesting they are investing for a long battle — even as the death toll rises.”

As a result, we have 20+ million new unemployed nation wide in a matter of weeks and millions of people falling in between any kind of government support. According to recent research this virus poses almost no risk to most working age people, so people are understandably frustrated with the way things have been handled.

The problem is that there is no middle ground. Some people want to stay fully locked down until there is a vaccine while others are saying they can’t make their rent this month. I think eventually we need to come to terms with the fact that the current situation is not sustainable, and we need to work on a long term solution that allows people to support their families and keep the people at risk as safe as possible.

I’m saying this as a liberal who is opposed to a full lockdown. This is just my perspective, and obviously everyone has their own reasons to be against it.
