Long answer You dont need to be the majority to gain power in a democracy you just need to depress voter turn outs,  play up xenophobia and conspiracy theories while being nationalistic. The more you can make the xenophobia, the conspiracies and your brand of nationalism normal the more people will agree, this is especially effective in nations with multiple parties because the often more same progressive and liberal parties wont be united in the way to do goals but are united in what the goals are where as the smaller nationalism party agree in goals and how to do it even if it openly clashes with reality. 

Social media alone does 99% of the leg work but the bigger reason why / how they gain power is the result of slow or complete inaction on major problems.

1. We didnt KNOW it was overblown at the beginning. Hell, I remember seeing videos of people dying in the streets in China and Iran and was told *from the same conspiracy people  you see at these rallies* that it was 10x worse than the ""media"" was portraying it as. Obviously that didnt happen in major 1st world nations, but we still had NO idea what we were dealing with at the start. The overreaction is justified when you are faced with a novel pathogen and no time to study it, despite it actively spreading.
2. We know more now. The lockdowns are largely over. What weve finally arrived at (after a lot of debate, because again, we had little information to go off of), is that life can return, but it must be done with precautions to reduce transmission while we wait for viable treatments or simply let the science catch up to itself once we have more stats on how it effects people. Ergo, masks and distancing (when possible).

But no...these same people dont want that, either. They want life to continue unabated, even though they are simply not qualified to make that judgement call for the whole of society. They think it should just burn through the population so we can reach ""herd immunity"", despite that being something that has ONLY been achieved via a vaccine. In other pandemics prior, it simply caused a massive, massive death toll. **They are selfish pricks, who (ironically) would be the first to rush to the hospital if they or someone they loved was experiencing a severe case of COVID19.**

The response to the rapid virus spread has been flawed; humans in general are flawed and mistakes are always made at every level of leadership for just about every issue we have faced. But that doesnt mean it was intentional, diabolical or malicious. And it doesnt mean that we should revert to ""normal life"" when it hasnt even been a full year of studying the new virus within the human body.",0,people shocked happens country lmao obviously isn ’ t country filled idiot reddit like think, surprise,0.899416625,  neutral,0.039684728,  realization,0.038959935

My wife god a horrible flu and still has lung damage from it. Her Aunt got a really bad flu and almost died from pneumonia. This has been proven, in the most conservative estimates, to be approx 5x WORSE than a ""bad flu"". 

The complicating factor is the unusually high asymptomatic rate of nearly 40% (well see in time though) and another significant percentage of ""mild cases"". The virus is clearly a roll of the dice and has caused a large amount of excess deaths, but I guess if its not like ebola with a 50% CFR and causing people to die in the streets, its simply not ""severe enough"" to warrant the measures weve taken to try and save lives (and I dont just mean deaths, either).",0,comment removed because incivility isn ’ t allowed sub want encourage respectful discussion information http www reddit com r coronavirus wiki rule wiki rule 1 3a civil bot action performed automatically contact moderator subreddit message compose to= r coronavirus question concern, disapproval,0.873462021,  neutral,0.118165314,  approval,0.002154131

New cases? All other scandinavian countries tested more, up to 4x what sweden did. Still sweden has more infections. Wondering if it is really flattening the curve or it is just a test amount limit.
Deaths? Many times more deaths compared to the other scandinavian countries. With constant lags since months.
ICU not being full? Partly true but also due to not admitting elderly patients as reported by swedish sources. Again no other scandinavian country had the healthcare system overwhelmed.
Economy? Not doing so different than other scandinavian countries. Will be interesting to see when others will reopen borders if they will include sweden. If not.. that is not going to help the swedish economy.
Herd immunity? Being moved forward on a biweekly base since 2 months. Still none knows how long the antibodies will last. If they last a few months the entire concept would make no sense.
Protecting the elderly? They admitted this is not working as expected.
Better protection for second wave? Assuming the antibodies will still be effective the other countries are not just waiting for the second wave to happen. They already got extra beds ready, they have massive testing in place, they are starting general screenings, they have isolation plans, they have tools to perform constant monitoring, ventilatora and PPE supplies are good.

So there is no indicator at all that the plan is good compared to the other scandinavian countries, countries that are closer to sweden not only on the world map but also culturally (more social distancing) and in density and area.

Then if daily numbers are not what they like they say they are just a little off and anyhow if you are not born and raised in sweden and live there you are stupid by definition and cannot understand this amazing plan.

The only people that say they are doing good are those with no basic math knowledge or they are just defending some kind of mass murder.

For them density is not crucial in the spread of a disease.
For them comparing the absolute number of deaths is normal so they are doing great conpared to a country with 33 times the population.
For them timing does not matter, those who got hit suddely and had no way to see that coming were in the same position of those who had examples and data to follow and had time to sit down and plan.

Sorry for the long post. TLDR The metric used is more complex than any single number, and the strategy is long-term.

First Swedens approach is more holistic, not looking at only the spread of the virus, but also at things like mental health, domestic violence, childrens education, vitamin D deficiency (a real problem every early spring!), etc, etc... If a harder lock-down could have prevented an additional 1000 deaths, but at the additional cost of 100 women beaten by their husbands, 10,000 children falling behind in school, and 10,000 jobs lost, is it the right choice to make? There is no right answer of course, but there is a wrong one ignoring everything except the death rate is not right. Yet its what everyone always seems to do in these discussions. The decision to keep elementary schools open came from this, since we dont want a ""lost generation"" of schoolchildren too young to learn effectively on-line.

Second Swedens strategy is *significantly* more long-term than any other countrys. While other countries have set dates for when they will open their countries back up, and then pushed those dates forward, Sweden have said from the start that their measures may have to stay in place until mass vaccination is complete *in 2-5 years time*. What will happen when countries open back up? Germany saw their R-number rise above 1.0 again, and had to partially backtrack, for instance. This will not happen to Sweden, since we arent planning on lifting the restrictions.

Some governments are hoping that Test, Trace, and Isolate (TTI) will prevent a second wave, but we seem to forget that we were doing TTI before the first wave! All through late January and February, most European countries (with the notable exception of the UK) did contact tracing of their Covid cases, but were unable to stop the wave from materializing. Sure, weve learned more since then, but can we really be confident that a second wave wont happen?

Third The strategy is working! The death rate is currently half of what it was at its peak! Our ICUs have never been full (and no, old people were *not* being denied intensive care any more than they normally are, except for a few individual cases at one hospital, which is being investigated). We have had fewer deaths per capita than Belgium, Spain, Italy, the UK, France, New York State, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and are about to be overtaken by several US states, the US as a whole, Russia, and probably Brazil. I dont really understand why people seem so eager to complain at Sweden, when we are arguably doing better than many other countries.

Also, there is a lot of misinformation going around. Since herd immunity isnt, and has never been, the goal of the Swedish strategy, having to push the herd immunity date forward is not a failure. Its actually a success, since it means that you were better at preventing people from catching the disease than you thought you were going to be. Also, a lot of people seem to think that Swedens strategy is to do nothing except issue vague recommendations, which is absolutely not the case. There are strict rules *as well as* recommendations, and there are businesses that have been fined and shut down for breaking those rules.

You are right in one thing tough The lack of adequate tests is a failure. And the government have admitted this, saying that they havent reached the testing targets they sought. Also, that the disease was allowed to spread into our nursing homes is a tragedy, and this has also been admitted by the government. It seems to have happened because we lacked a strategic emergency supply of PPE beforehand, which Ill gladly admit is extremely dumb.",0,select metric experiment don ’ t backfit data, neutral,0.899960756,  disapproval,0.090568244,  approval,0.003889944

I cant count the downvotes I got when saying how catastrophically stupid the UKs herd immunity plan was - when they were outright saying that was the plan. I know British citizens in real life who thought it was a good plan. They had no conception that getting herd immunity means you let the virus ravage the country. They might as well have said that their plan was to do nothing, because thats what it was. Fortunately for the UK, Boris caught Coronavirus and started to realize how serious it was (yes mods, I said it was fortunate that a specific person caught it - that probably saved 10,000+ lives). Unfortunately for Brazil, Bolsanaro caught it and was asymptomatic, and then engaged on a full-fledged denial campaign.

Turns out full lockdowns are actually kind of useless related to preventing deaths. Because your inmune system doesnt watch the news to see if everyone is lock down, and then it mounts a defense.

Sweden is doing statistical representative testning to come to accurate infection numbers.

>Many times more deaths compared to the other scandinavian countries. With constant lags since months.

A large part of the deaths are found in eldercare homes, and are people which would have died in the same period regardless. There is no statistical significant amount of extra death compared to other years. The difference between Sweden and Denmark/Norway may as well have to do with different ways of counting deaths. If there were errors done in the eldercare (I havent heard anything as crazy, as New York & Michigan putting Corona patients in elder care homes), then that is unfortunate, but unlikely it had anything to do with the Swedish Corona strategy. Sweden closed elder homes for visitors before Denmark did.

You forgot to mention the local diversity when comparing the Scandinavian countries. For example, the capital region of Denmark and the neighboring Swedish Region ""Skåne"" have roughly the same size of population, same geography, and are connected by a bridge that is locked down from the danish side. So not a whole lot of mixing between the two regions. The death rate on the Danish side - who chooses the lockdown strategy, is more than 3 times higher than the Swedish region.  


Why didnt you mention that in your facts?  


Regarding economy you dont mention public spending. Interesting regarding the Scandinavian countries have a very large public part of their economy covered by public spending. The latest study shows that Denmark has spent 2 billion Swedish kronor more per day compared to Sweden since the virus started. With this going on for a couple of months so far, it adds up. And since European countries dont adhere to the American ""just print more money"" strategy, those billions will have to be collected somehow in the future.  


Regarding opening up the borders, you speculate if Scandinavian countries will open up their borders to Sweden. Maybe you are not European and dont understand the concept of the EU, but very simplified they dont have much choice. And tell me, why would Denmark not open their borders to Sweden when the only regions with borders is Skåne with one-third of the deaths the danish side of the borders have? Shouldnt it be Sweden closing those borders to Denmark?

Antibody tests are not fully accurate. Daily deaths in Sweden are down, which follows a similar curve in other countries. 

Where Sweden DID mess up, much like many parts of the US (and admitted it, unlike the US) was protecting long term care facilities.

The number of deaths at elder care homes are not spectacular compared to a regular flu-season. January - April 2020 saw around 11,000 deaths, the same period 2019 saw 10,000 deaths.

Norway, Finland, Denmark, The Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland. 

Sweden alone has such a high infection burden and death rate. This is causing the other Nordic countries to very seriously considering keeping borders closed with Sweden while opening to each other and other countries such as Germany,s Czech Republic, South Korea, Taiwan, etc. where its under control. 

Swedens strategy has left it with 1. a much higher death toll and disease burden 2. an economy that is just as and by some metrics more harmed and 3. a status as a pariah state. Its ranking by Standard Ethics has been downgraded as a result of its actions so far, and I think this doesnt even include the new informatinon about it subjecting many elderly people to ""active euthanasia"" in the words of a famous Swedish doctor. 

>Press Release  London, 21 May 2020 Sweden Standard Ethics RatingDowngradingLondon,  21  May  2020. Standard  Ethics  downgrades  the Kingdom  of  Sweden’s  Standard  Ethics  Rating (SER) to “EEE-” from “EEE” 1. During  the  first  phase  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  Swedish  health  policy  did  not  comply  with World Health Organization recommendations. Standard Ethics analysts believe that this produced additional risks for the Swedish and European population. The current health policy seems to be part of a general strategy that is not collaborative with the European Union

You have to get infected first in order to get antibodies, unless theres a vaccine. Why dont people get this? All this infect-young-to-protect-elderly bs dont work unless elderly are perfectly quarantined until all youngsters get it and develop antibodies. Not gonna happen.

Whats gonna happen is this. Infected will either 1) die 2) spread disease 3) stay in isolation until  he/she can no longer spread disease(has antibody). Most likely route is #2. So thats like, doing nothing, because thats whats most likely going to happen when you do nothing.

The best, and the only right way is test-track-isolate. Other measures, whatever they are, are second best at most. By this measure Sweden isnt doing great at all.
