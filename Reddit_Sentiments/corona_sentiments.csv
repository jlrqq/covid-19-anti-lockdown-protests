Is it overly family spread? Is it public spaces? I know in NJ our nursing homes are getting ravaged. Two weeks go (approximately) 75/350 facilities had one positive case, last week it went to 150, today it topped 300, that's not 300 cases, 300 facilities. I understand things are hectic but it's aggravating that patients can't report in some public manner how they believe they got it or where they went. 

The only human contact I've had outside my immediate family has been touching mail/boxes/grocery/take out deliveries. If I were to catch it right now it would have to be one of those as I have no 0 human to human contact. Understanding this would help leaps and bounds to understand if certain stores are becoming super spreader locations or if most the people sick had contacts who tested positive.

I believe the German Heinsberg study supports this claim. It supports prolonged face-to-face contact being the primary mechanism of spread.

The plan, as sold to basically every developed nation from day one, was to take the number of people who would be infected by and, yes, even die from this disease and stretch them out over a longer time horizon.  We were trying to stretch the X-axis while keeping the Y-axis lower.  Yes, this can result in fewer overall infections, but the bulk of people who would ultimately be infected or exposed to infection is still a majority of the population.

Lockdowns can only be justified on the basis of EXCESS mortality caused by inadequate medical capacity (ie. the curve exceeding the capacity line).  There is no difference between 300 deaths per million being spread out over 6 months or happening in 2 months, so long as the peak does not cause that number of deaths to skyrocket to 400 or 500 deaths per million because of inadequate supply of hospital resources.

What we know now is that hospital capacity is exceeding demand in most places, to the point where we have empty hospitals and sufferers of other afflictions being pushed aside.  The curve is flattened well below where it needs to be.

Before you throw Sweden vs. Norway vs. Denmark out there, consider this question: is Sweden going to have substantially more deaths per million than those countries when all is said and done?  Or are they just going through them a little quicker?  Is Sweden suffering from **excess** mortality compared to other countries due to their decisions?  Are they running out of capacity causing unnecessary loss of life?

Yah, it is fascinating that the Bay Area order primarily was about hospital capacity, but that clearly is not an issue at this point after peaking almost a week ago.

All said, you can justify a lockdown to be able to build up a contact tracing and testing network.  If you can keep covid19 to a low level like in South Korea (4 deaths a day in a country of 50 million), you will have a drastically better outcome than herd immunity.  2 years out you are at 60 deaths per million compared to NYC's herd immunity level of 1k.",0,positive

THANK YOU!

Here in Canada practically every hospital is well under projections. Ontario was supposed to have 1000-1200 people in the ICU a couple days ago, they had 289. Despite the fact it was nearly 4x lower than projected, headlines called it a ""Glimmer of Hope"" and the Premier extended the state of emergency. There are many reports of nurses and medical staff having hours reduced because the hospitals do not have patients. This has an impact on people who would otherwise be getting treatment; how do we justify the lockdown to a person who's cancer metastasized because their appointment was postponed when the hospital was empty? How do we count their death statistically? 

Trudeau suggested today that a gradual reopening of the economy may happen in the next few weeks. My hunch is that they are still using the modeling that suggested a peak in May, but that model's validity and reliability comes into question when you consider how inaccurate the predictions have been. Now to be fair, we have seen a doubling in reported deaths today from what had been reported yesterday (63 to 123), so it is possible that we have not yet reached the peak. However it remains to be seen if this was an outlier or a backlog of cases from the long weekend, as deaths have been relatively stable until now. Also, 118 of those 123 deaths came from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. It seems clear to me that in all other provinces the pandemic has reached its peak and could begin reducing social distancing measures immediately.

They’re talking as if we need to get to 0 deaths during this lockdown - not just 0 covid deaths but 0 of all infectious disease deaths. Does the media report people are dying of the flu still? Nope. Does the media report that people are in desperate need to get on dialysis right now butt can’t because hospitals are only treating covid? No. 

We have covid mania and have forgotten that other illnesses exist and still need treatment. A lockdown of 1+ year would see many countless cancer patients die for lack of treatment, same with a host of other illnesses.

I would love to think society could start to function with masks and social distancing, but where I live people are still having parties, the store is full of people without masks (like 90% don't), and our cases are increasing daily and people STILL aren't taking this seriously.

A good look at what will happen if we open up without real precaution is the meat packing plant that was just forced to close. Many employees contracted it, and the plant could no longer function as some died or were hospitalized, and others just walked off the job. People may long to return to work, but what happens when 50% of the company ends up out for weeks, hospitalized, or dead? Look at Hazelton, PA. It's a small town where now something like 1 in 25 people have it. Yet, the people still won't abide by social distancing, and the mayor has implemented a curfew and the county manager has now asked the national guard to step in to enforce it.

Then there is the post-infection stage. MERS and SARS left survivors with permanent issues and post-viral CFS type illness that continues, there is concern that same is happening with COVID19. There are questions as to whether COVID19 remains dormant and reactivates as some patients are again symptomatic and testing positive. Liver and kidney damage along with neurological complaints are present post-infection. Some people's lungs are sustaining damage that remains.

Wrong. They should mostly be an opportunity to roll out an efficient testing protocol nation wide (which should be at least of the magnitute of 100k tests for a medium sized nation in order to address almost immediatly any new infection nest), to screen sieroconverted people with sierological testing, to make people understand what they'll inevitably go through again in case they won't respect social distances for the next year or wear masks, to build PPE in country in a war-time like fashion and not to rely on foreign enflated markets and makers.

Lifting a lockdown without these things sorted out, and they will be very difficult for anyone to be sorted out in a half dozen of weeks, will inhevitably bring a nation on the brink collapse again after less than two months, since the virus will be always circulating again from the start at sub-clinical levels.

You can upgrade your icu beds nationwide by a factor of 2, 3, 4, even 5, but you'll never know when and where the next infection will start. At that point, 500 icu beds rather than 100 in that metropolitan center will help you only that much. Considering you reach again the point of infections needed to saturate your previous ICU infrastructure (so let's say indeed 100 beds) you only need to wait (so to fuck around ) around a week more to saturate your upgraded infrastructure. So long icu beds bought with the blood and tears of your first lockdown. They'll go down the shitter in a matter of days. And I believe it could be pretty easy to fuck up in case the testing protocols won't be capillary. The margin is extremely thin once the curve starts to skyrocket, and in case you don't have an efficient testing net it's very easy to let the curve grow again unnoticed.

Hospital capacity will risk saturating in any case if another lockdown will risk being needed. It's much more efficient and logical to divert the priority on developing a survellaince infracture so that the hospital capacity of today keeps being enough.

You know, I don't think we're mature enough to recognize what *a lot* of dead people is either.

Unfortunately the best methods would be with the use of testing/antibody testing (that aren't ready yet) and measures that fundamentally go against traditionally American ideals of freedom; like mandatory tracking, etc.

In the interim we would need to have phases for reopening, guidelines and rules to maintain social distancing, wearing masks, requiring businesses to close midday for cleaning. All the while mandating companies that can work from home, work from home, and those that can't, provide rolling systems that rotate in workers. This, in theory, would be very communal in nature and limiting restaurants to half to 1/4 capacity to provide space between patrons.

Schools would be the same way. Classrooms would cut class sizes by 2/3rds and only come to school 1 day a week on a rotating basis while distance learning the remainder of the time.

Sports would come back, but players would have to be tested and obviously not play to large crowds until a vaccine or herd immunity is reached.

Older and at risk populations should still stay home and/or only allowed to go out on certain days. I'm not sure how this would work. But I'd imaging something like those with a certain social security number range can go out at certain times etc.

Again these are just brainstorms of what I think may happen. I do know that people will get restless if there isn't an effort to reopen in another month or so.

There’s no way half of your suggestions would work (certainly not in America where people feel entitled, right or wrong) because it would be “infringing” on people’s rights. One of my growing concerns and questions as this goes on and people throw out suggestions on what to do: how many rights are we willing to give up to solve an essentially unsolvable problem (is this isn’t going to just go away, it’s not a black and white situation with any absolutes other then we’ll always live with this). And this is coming from a place of remembering post-9/11 and the Patriot Act. Yes, some of those measures “worked” but at the cost of doing irreparable harm and consolidating power that has been abused and manipulated for private interests.

I think what will most likely happen, is that things will open back up. Measures will be taken and they simply won’t be draconian enough. People will have a greater false sense of security (which I think the use of “masks” is gradually creating and easing us into) and there will be a second wave that will be absolutely demoralizing and drive people not only back into their homes, but to do their own contact-testing. Fear-mongering that will be enmeshed in racism, classism—whatever tangible othering that might give one a sense of control over what is quickly unfolding.

People might, for a time, accept the deaths occurring and rationalize them. But if this gets out of control or mutates, people will quickly be driven back into their homes not out of government order, but out of fear. And that’s far more deadly.

We can accept that this is the new normal, or we can be stubbornly opposed and refuse to adjust our lives accordingly. There’s an arrogance of imperviousness our modern-times lends itself to. An inflexibility woven into the rat-race speed we’ve grown accustomed to. 

Obviously this can all play out a number of different ways. And maybe we’ll get a more positive outcome.

Because the 'vulnerable' aren't just old people. How many middle aged smokers, inactive and obese people are out there? Their chances of survival are much lower than mine and yours, so I guess you keep those locked away too? Good luck.

Isn't hypertension a big issue with Covid? How many people are unaware they have it, or have undetected heart conditions for example. Plus the hospilisation rate (and recovery time) is too high to just let it tear through the 'non vulnerable' without you collapsing health services. 

How would you distinguish who the vulnerable are exactly? It's great to tell them to stay home when everyone else is, but the moment you let the 'non vulnerable' out, who is stopping the vulnerable population from following suit?

Flattening the curve also broadens it; the integral doesn't change, the limits do. In other words, flattening the curve doesn't change the area under the curve (total deaths), it instead spreads them out over time. And it could result that more deaths occur from flattening in that the virus stays around longer and has more opportunity to infect the vulnerable.

By doing that, herd immunity will develop faster, without overwhelming the health system, if it is managed carefully.

One month later with quarantine procedures in place we have roughly 28,000 cases and 1000 deaths (Which I'm happy those numbers are low and realize that without a quarantine early on they would be much worse) but this still feels like the early phase of the virus, and complete destruction of our healthcare system seems to be on the horizon once we have more activity in our communities and businesses. 

There are still so many people that can become sick from this virus, and it seems as though we haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of number of people that may become infected.

If the eastern countries are successful, we shouldn't we try to imitate the process? If the tracking is invasive, isn't that better than death? If a lot of people die, 1) it could be someone you know that you didn't think would die, 2) it could be you, even though you think that it shouldn't be, 3) if intelligencia and mid-level leaders die our brain trust will be depleted, which results in a poorer outlook for you, your descendants, our economy, and there may be unintended consequences like poorer medical care because research goes down, poor decision-making results, and government instability happens, 4) if a lot of people are sick, they are either too sick to spend money, or they feel sad because someone they know is sick so they don't spend money.  We have a huge country, similar to many countries put together, so if we are re-opening, then maybe quarantining off states or sections of multiple states, like smaller countries do, might make sense to try contain the virus and preserve contact tracing, until vast testing and or a vaccine is found. It sounds like we will need a lot of $ and a lot of taxes to bail the country out. Also, we have to weigh lives against utility, does it make sense to have a lot of people die for entertainment or sport? Are certain industries crucial for functioning and security that we have to preserve? Can we pivot to employ people in areas and so they can still work in a way that is safe for the population at large including the vulnerable, without tributes or darwinian thinking? How do we rationalize whose life is more valuable and whose are disposable when we pick ourselves as part of that more valuable population, and or we pick ourselves as becoming self-enriched by the decision equation at the expense of others' lives, anyway? We were in a world war for 4 years and everyone made sacrifices for four years. We've been in this current situation for about a month. We can be stronger than one month's worth, as a nation, I think. Are we strong enough to last 13 weeks? Can some of us go back to work six to 13 feet apart like we see in the factory pictures? We can survive this together, change and become stronger. But we need government help and strategy and we all have to make some sacrifices, rather than some people called upon to make all of the sacrifice, especially without their choosing. Going fast medically and scientifically  makes sense.  I don't think we should pivot the industry too fast in either direction and because it sounds like it needs lead time to adjust to what it is already trying to change and meet, otherwise our haste to reopen for fear of our jobs and lack of a high level of entertainment could backfire.",1,positive

You dont wanna be the country that picked money over saving lives.

Another thing that really concerns me of such a scenario, is health care workers, months of extreme lockdown-less load would be impossible to handle, not only they would be at a constant risk of a high-viral load exposure and many would die, we would see strikes demanding action, and the endless need for resources would also be a massive amount of money.

This detail is often lost in internet discussion. The experts say, let people travel, but do health screening, do isolation and quarantine, do contact tracing. This is basically what the Asia Pacific countries did, and they are mostly fairing pretty well.

If every country had done this early, the virus would have been contained. But they didn't. The high number of infection across the world means that it's no longer feasible for smaller countries to isolate and screen all international traveler, so it is now necessary to close the border.

""In theory travel restrictions could work if you stopped 99% of all air travel, but it would be so economically damaging that it wouldn't be worth doing. We're a large country that relies a lot on cross-border trade (with the US), so we can't do that, only small island countries can"".

> Restricting  99%  of  air  travel  could  provide  an  additional  1-2  months  for  vaccine  administration. However, such drastic restrictions are not economically feasible and are predicted to delay  viral  spread  but  not  impact  overall  morbidity.

> In general,  border  control  has  limited  effectiveness   in   large   countries   with   porous  borders.  Given  the  current  scale  of  air  transport,  effective  border  control  would  require  unrealistic  detection  rates  in  order  to  delay  or  limit  transmission.  However,  border  control  may  be  effective  in  small  island  settings  with  a   limited   number   of   travellers   where   quarantine   of   incoming   travellers   for   >8.6  days  could  have  99%  effectiveness  in  preventing  the  release  of  infectious  individuals   into   the   community.

However going to the current top comment. Not all of it.

If they weren't able to effectively shut down borders they would have been re-infected and achieved the destroyed economy plus high COVID death outcome.  Similarly if people did not widely comply the same outcome would occur.  

California had some of the earliest and strictest lock downs, they eased those lock downs late as well.  However they are now dealing with it over and over.  New York got Waxed early but is not seeing any significant increase in cases now that restrictions are lifting.

It seems in the united states the full elimination plan is doomed, due to 50 independent governments and a ""don't tell me what to do"" population.

The risky approach is trying to stop it due to the worst of both worlds outcome upon failure, and the fact that the government is only a small part of the success or failure of it. I can see why people would have a problem with just letting it run rampant though.

we urgently need an app that saves your location info locally on your phone (if you are concerned for your privacy) or online (china already has this, korea as well from what i heard) and only IF you get infected can share the data. to prevent misuse only doctors and health authorities should be able to unlock the infection status.

the location could be saved locally, but it should be possible for everyone to trace back the route of infected people on a map and get warnings, if they have been close to someone infected.

this would make it much easier to know if you have been at risk and can self contain or at least be much more careful not to infect anyone else.

the big tech companies should have had something like this ready for months. what are they waiting for. facebook and other social media platforms should also have an option to input this info there, so people can see that friends got infected. of course you need to verify infections by health authorites there as well, so that people do not randomly put their status as infected.",0,neutral

You'll notice a few things from those screenshots and the second video:

1. About 60-80% of people are wearing masks in May, and most of the masks are rather high-quality: surgical or KN95 masks, not cloth or sponge masks.

2. There were less than 10% as many people on the street as normal.

That isn't surprising.  Not everyone is going back to business-as-usual with behaviors the same as Jan/early-Feb.  A lot of people are still choosing to act like stay at home orders are still in effect.  Many people that are out are still social distancing.  The virus won't start doubling every 3 days again.  It looks like in multiple US states the virus is hitting roughly 2-3 week long doubling times and it will take some time for those numbers to build up (see https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-states/).  Those states are all seeing upticks now, but it'll probably be another 2-3 weeks before the trend starts to be really measurable.

People who check almost all the lists for COVID symptoms still test negative on antibody tests months after the first symptom appeared. Question is if that is balanced out by possible false positives.

There is also some evidence of some people only having mucosal antibodies against COVID (which might not prevent infection). It seems that some cases do not develop antibodies, or detectable ones anyway.

If I understand right, they're saying that if R0 = 2.5 and you want to get it down to 1.0, then you can do that by cutting down to 1/2.5 = 0.4x normal contacts. Or, assuming a serial interval of a week, you can alternate six-week periods with full normal contacts, during which the case count will go up by a factor of 2.5^6 = 244, followed by six-week periods with R = (1/244)^(1/6) = 1/R0 = 0.4, during which it will go back down. For R = 0.4 you need 0.16x normal contacts.

Assuming that your utility is proportional to average number of contacts, the intermittent case is better, since (1 + 0.16)/2 = 0.58 > 0.4. Then they also show that under various broader assumptions about utility, the result still holds, and claim the intermittent also has fewer infected (and thus fewer deaths; though I'm not sure of their assumptions there, since I don't understand why the steady Reff = 1 case is resting at the maximum from the intermittent, and not the minimum or somewhere in between). I understand from their references that the basic idea that alternating strict/loose may be better than steady intermediate is already known in epidemiology, and the now-famous Ferguson paper had actually modeled it at the end in Figure 4.

Good luck actually implementing that, though. Maybe the practical challenges could be managed if the schedule was predictable, but that's still a pretty awkward way to run a factory/restaurant/whatever, with a cost in that complexity that their model doesn't capture. And the comments here show that while the (unrealistic) ""lock down really hard until the virus is eradicated"" has some political popularity, this clearly does not.

However, there are quite a few 'assumptions' that are made that need to be addressed.

1. Compliance. They have assumed a high degree of compliance with the strict measures when they are in effect. Lack of compliance can bridge the gap between cycles, reducing their effects to a larger degree than with longer, less stringent measures.

2. Testing. The concept of using controlled cycles to optimize results is based on both regular testing, and a short period for results. At this time there are still large portions of the US that do not have adequate testing. In addition, infected individuals are often not aware of their status for a week or more. When you are looking at cycles that can be as short as two weeks, this is highly problematic.

3. Quarantine. The assumption is always made that individuals that are identified as infected are quarantined, and removed from community spread. Unfortunately this is not the case, as there is an  ever increasing amount of acceptance for infected individuals interacting in the community. It has even gotten to the point in the US where Congress is looking to pass laws protecting companies if they allow for infected individuals to remain at work (especially in jobs considered essential).

Saving lives is the point.  You can argue that the cost isn't worth it, but to say there is no point is to pretend this virus can't spread.  

Assuming the spread of this virus will have the same reaction to warm weather as the spread of coronaviruses where the population is always near herd immunity so slight fluctuations of R0 will bring it above and below 1:1 is not sensible.

However, as someone on another side of the debate, I am frustrated by the once side-ness of this error correction.

Using synthetic data over the model to validate its capability is a good idea. However, this is not the first paper that failed this basic test. For example, the exact same idea has also been implemented to argue against Chernozhukov et al. (see the analysis [here](https://cspicenter.org/blog/waronscience/lockdowns-econometrics-and-the-art-of-putting-lipstick-on-a-pig/)). However, Chernozhukov et al. claimed benefits for NPIs and was never retracted.

This is despite Chernozhukov et al. being one of the best papers to claim that NPIs work. Flaxman et al, For example, is one of the more influential papers regarding the efficacy of NPIs, and its methodology is extremely, let's say, problematic. (I consider the country-specific effects they added under the rug to be borderline fraudulent).  Flaxman Et al, has 1741 citations as of now and were never retracted: For it, a short [response](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/12/25/flaxman-et-al-respond-to-criticisms-of-their-estimates-of-effects-of-anti-coronavirus-policies/) with dodgy excuses (and results that fully contradict what's published in the paper) was deemed sufficient.",1,neutral

The claim that lockdowns have absolutely *no* effect on the R value is clearly an extreme position (which some people do hold, nevertheless). On the other side, claiming that a few more weeks of lockdown would permanently eradicate covid is also clearly nonsense, as we've seen from the experiences of Australia and NZ with the Delta wave.

Between those extremes are a whole range of fuzzy questions:

* Do lockdowns actually save lives or just spread the deaths over a longer period of time?
* Are lockdowns a reasonable long-term strategy or just a temporary reprieve to roll out vaccinations or build more ventilators?
* Does a ""lockdown"" include voluntary actions by individuals following government advice and recommendations, or does it require strict legislation and enforcement?
* Do lockdowns promote or suppress the evolution of new variants (and are these variants more or less dangerous)?
* Are the negative effects of lockdowns greater or lesser in the long term than the damage done by the virus?

As for robust papers showing an effect, Flaxman or Chernozhukov are clearly not the most robust. I would consider Hsiang et al. (nature) and Brauner et al. (science) to be much more robust.

That being said, I don't deny that there are problematic papers on both end of the spectrum, but clearly the ones claiming no effect can only be bogus, because it's obvious that NPIs would have an effect. The debate is in the size of th effect and on whether or not it's worth it and for how long considering other parameters. 

As for Flaxman's and their response, it's not dodgy and discussed at length on many blogs and websites from statisticians (Gelman also discussed it for instance) and it's come to the general consensus that it does provide some weak evidence of the effect of NPIs.",0,neutral

We all know the moral issues with trying to go for herd immunity, but to add to those, reaching herd immunity takes hosts. Each host is an opportunity for the virus to mutate.

They tend to go that way over becoming more deadly as killing the host means the virus stops spreading. 

They think that the driving force behind this particular strain was someone with compromised immune system. The virus was presumably running rampant in her body. They treated her with monoclonal antibodies. That would have applied a selection pressure for changes to the spike protein, which probably explains why so there werso many spontaneous changes to the spike protein. Her crippled immune system wasn't enough to fully wipe the virus, however, so it kept mutating.

She was presumably in hospital. I'd assume that the mutated virus ""escaped"" by infecting the medical staff. That would have again selected for the more virulent strains, able to more easily infect people in tiny quantities - despite distancing, PPE, and so on.

Is the strain as virulent as the government claim? Possibly, but also possibly not. It's possible that this strain had its growth accelerated by reaching the schools just as the same seasonal effects that cause the flu season took hold. Still, as the article says the evidence continues to point to the idea that this strain could be more contagious. 

I'm not sure if anyone can say that the lockdown is at fault here. If allowed to run through the population then there would be even more opportunity fothe virus to mutate, including more opportunities for the virus to infect people with compromised immune systems.

Mass testing would be great. They've done some trials. My guess is that it'll take a lot of test manufacturing as well as testing capacity. It's also a big logistical challenge, and could backfire...

There's a truism that viruses tend to evolve to become less deadly and more infectious.

It's obvious that, all else being equal, a virus will gradually become as infectious as possible -- that's natural selection 101.

So, then: why would a virus become less deadly? The argument is that, once a host dies, it becomes incapable of spreading the virus that killed it; therefore, from an evolutionary perspective, a dead host is a bad host.

There are several problems with this, though. Most notably:

1. A virus could take a really long time to become less deadly. Variola major (smallpox) existed for *at least* thousands of years, and it had an estimated 30% mortality rate when it was eradicated.
2. A virus might not experience much selective pressure to become less deadly. This is the big one for COVID-19: current evidence suggests that people are most infectious just before they start showing symptoms, and that most people don't even have live virus in their systems around a week after symptoms appear. In other words, most people who die from COVID-19 already stopped spreading long ago. So COVID-19 might not have much of a ""reason"" to become less deadly.",0,negative

However, if 1 year is lost on average for each of 20 million long-term job losses, that is 20 million “person years” of life lost, nearly 20 times as bad. Yes, many of these deaths will happen over an extended timeline, although some due to addiction, violence, and suicide are happening already. But still, this is a colossal loss of life, also tragic, let no one dispute it.

Not to mention the possibility that all these deaths many not be prevented, and instead just pushed into the near future.

The conclusions people come to with studies like this are flawed because we have not yet experienced the outcome of the pandemic or the second-order effects of the mitigation strategies used to prevent or delay deaths. I'm concerned these types of early predictions will be used to justify further action by governments who may be underestimating the total burden these strategies place on a population.

> On average, implementation of any physical distancing intervention was associated with an overall reduction in covid-19 incidence of 13% (IRR 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.89; n=149 countries). 

So they're saying that with lockdowns, the incidence goes from x to x*(1 - 0.13). Isn't that an absurdly small change? The USA has incidence >1000x that of Taiwan, and they're talking about a 13% difference? What's funny is that I simultaneous believe that (a) per below, this is scientifically meaningless econometric sludge that wouldn't have been published if not for the strong demand for something--anything--to justify the lockdowns in retrospect; and (b) its headline result grossly understates the benefits of lockdowns, because it lumped half-hearted ones with strict ones.

Perhaps the editors were relying on the public not to read past the title, not even to the abstract? That seems awfully cynical, but also seems to be exactly what has happened in this post. I think the editorial writers basically agree that the paper is awful, but can't quite bring themselves to say it. Quoting:

> Their results might be viewed in the same way as preliminary data used in grant applications: the evidence so far is suggestive of a particular conclusion but not good enough to rely on, so a more rigorous study is needed. The study’s conclusions are probably correct, but we cannot know this for certain from case data collected so unsystematically by countries around the world.

> Control strategies informed by flawed data might advance public health aims in the short term but do lasting damage to our ability to effect behavioral change through evidence in the future. We must be careful, then, not to mislead or overplay politically convenient findings and risk violating the public trust necessary for an effective pandemic response.


In any case, the paper authors' basic methodology is that for each of 149 countries, they reduced all the interventions applied by that country to five types. They did a regression that concluded countries that applied more interventions sooner had lower incidence of coronavirus. But that coarse analysis has pretty weird consequences. Their summary table puts the American and Chinese (PRC) responses in the same category, since both applied all five types of intervention (somewhere, at some time). The intensity or geographic extent of the intervention is disregarded. Korea and Japan are actually in a less strict category (same as Sweden), because they never closed public transportation. And the regression makes no attempt to adjust for different degrees of underascertainment, which is clearly a huge factor when they've included many small, low-income countries with minimal public health resources.

It's just generally bizarre that they included all these tiny countries. I couldn't find an explicit statement of whether they weighted equally or by population; but in the former case tiny populations have disproportionate effect, and in the latter they're insignificant. In either case, the authors' effort would have been better spent breaking big countries into sub-regions. And the only interventions studied are lockdown-type, so this fails to consider whether other factors (mask use, etc.) actually explain more of the difference. I don't see how anyone could believe such a grossly coarse methodology would yield any useful result; and returning to the policy question, I also don't believe that people advocating for lockdowns actually believe the effect on coronavirus incidence is just this paper's claimed -13%.

To be clear, I believe the lockdowns were justified in some cases but not others, and that they carry both tremendous benefit in controlling the virus and tremendous social cost. I don't believe this paper--or most econometric work, but this especially--does anything but degrade public confidence and understanding in science.",1,positive

You probably couldn’t find enough people who would take money to not see their family for months at a time (assume staff would need to be quarantined on site for at least aw week before patient contact and then get testa before they are cleared to work?). And this needs to apply for *all* staff.
It’s likely possible in a few cases, or by moving staff that is ready to accept this together in specific facilities. But it’s not going to be a general solution that can be implemented in hundreds of care homes across a country.

Perhaps if you could find enough old care staff (nearing retirement age) they could agree to isolate with their patients. They likely don’t have kids they need to see and they benefit from isolation too.

What is possible is likely to isolate patients better, evacuate those with infection to special facilities, and avoid transferring those who recovered from hospital straight back to the home they came from.

I have to add also that I think just counting “deaths” are a crude measure. A 90year old person dying is not as bad as a 50 year old person by any way of measuring. That reasoning is not valuing one persons life over another. One already lives theirs. A 50 year old person could live another 30 years even with diabetes or hypertension. Looking at death stats and saying “30% happen in care homes!” might sound like we could improve the situation by 30% if we make  those deaths zero. But that’s too simplistic.

Two things should be optimized for: 1. minimizing suffering using some measure like quality adjusted life years lost. 2. Preventing an overwhelmed health care system. 

The 30% deaths in care homes might represent 5% of the years lost to the disease.

Deaths in elderly homes are unnecessary because they feel preventable. We can do better. No one should die that way, perhaps without any family around. But deaths in care homes don’t matter much for the two things any strategy should optimize for: life years lost and health care system strain (these patients almost never need ICU care and often aren’t even transported to hospital la if they are really fragile).",0,positive

And that may work great... until we come to a pandemic that kills more youth than older adults. Ebola wasn't a perfect example, but it shows that this is possible:

There is also the matter of children. Don't know how it is where you are, but in the UK carers are largely women of child-rearing age. So children are often one contact away from vulnerable people, and that makes shielding the shielders a very difficult problem to solve.",0,negative

Do you honestly feel that nursing assistants at ALF’s would literally move in to the facility they work at? You’re of the belief that they don’t have families at home who are depending on them for care? They don’t have young children to care for, a home to maintain, or any other adult responsibilities? Sure there may be some who could just drop everything and move into a nursing facility but the large majority could not. 

Let’s also keep in mind that these facilities are becoming very difficult to staff as it is. A large number of nursing assistants have either gotten sick themself or quit out of fear of becoming sick. There isn’t a line of qualified people banging down the door to work in an ALF right now. Keeping the staff on premises would also increase their exposure and viral load making them more likely to become ill.

The mental strain placed on healthcare workers right now is off the charts. Anxiety, depression, and straight up fear. Staff need at least a brief chance to relax in a comforting place, take a long hot shower, maybe have a good cry, and recharge their batteries. Living IN the place that is causing this stress would surely limit their ability to recuperate and negatively affect the quality of care they are providing. 

I agree that more needs to be done, but thinking that the government could just throw money at nursing staff to coerce them into living on site is foolish. The staff needs better than that.",0,neutral

>Finally, we note that S&S would not be implemented in isolation. Measures such as contacting tracing (both traditional and app-based) could also facilitate exit from lockdown (Kucharski et al., 2020)

When people talk about segmentation and shielding high risk groups, we have found that this has been very hard even for countries who put in extra measures in place, like Sweden and nursing homes. We also know that nursing homes are not the only places where high risk individuals reside. In relation to the entire population of countries they are quite small.

>A key component of S&S is behavioural modification, not only for the vulnerable and shielder segments but also for the general population.

That is why a multi-pronged approach to exiting lockdowns will likely work best and that involves contact tracing. Trevor Bedford [demonstrates](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1254575445229441024) here that even a bad contact tracing program has massive benefits, especially when compared to costs. This can work in conjunction with other mitigation strategies like mask-wearing, mass gathering bans, along with additional measures for high risk groups.

We have examples all over the world where contact tracing works and even in the US (WA). That requires more tests and contact tracers.",1,positive

>Extroverts may enjoy lower mortality than introverts under normal circumstances, but the relationship may be different during an airborne pandemic when social contact can be deadly. We used data for midlife Americans surveyed in 1995-96 with mortality follow-up through December 31, 2020 to investigate whether the association between extroversion and mortality changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that excess mortality during the pandemic will be greater for extroverts than for introverts. Results were based on a Cox model estimating age-specific mortality controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, the period trend in mortality, and an additional indicator for the pandemic period (Mar-Dec 2020). We interacted extroversion with the pandemic indicator to test whether the relationship differed between prepandemic and pandemic periods. Prior to the pandemic, extroversion was associated with somewhat lower mortality (HR=0.93 per SD, 95% CI 0.88-0.97), but the relationship reversed during the pandemic: extroverted individuals appeared to suffer higher mortality than their introverted counterparts, although the effect was not significant (HR=1.20 per SD, 95% CI 0.93-1.54). Extroversion was associated with greater pandemic related excess mortality (HR=1.20/0.93=1.29 per SD, 95% CI 1.00-1.67). Compared with someone who scored at the mean level of extroversion, mortality rates prior to the pandemic were 10% lower for a person who was very extroverted (i.e., top 12% of the sample at Wave 1), while they were 12% higher for someone who was very introverted (i.e., 11th percentile). In contrast, mortality rates during the pandemic appeared to be higher for very extroverted individuals (HR=1.15, 95% CI 0.77-1.71) and lower for those who were very introverted (HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.43-1.14) although the difference was not significant because of limited statistical power. In sum, the slight mortality advantage enjoyed by extroverts prior to the pandemic disappeared during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains to be seen whether that pattern continued into 2021-22. We suspect that the mortality benefit of introversion during the pandemic is largely a result of reduced exposure to the risk of infection, but it may also derive in part from the ability of introverts to adapt more easily to reduced social interaction without engaging in self-destructive behavior (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse). Introverts have been training for a pandemic their whole lives.",1,neutral

Not just a small increase, a massive, tragic increase in the loss of life to suicides.

Actual scientific studies showed a substantial drop in suicide rates during the lockdowns.

Not only were first responders heavily affected by a confirmation bias phenomenon, once first responders started reporting a major uptick in suicides, there was a ‘common sense’ narrative that occurred spontaneously amongst most people:  “humans are social animals.  Of course the social isolation of the lockdowns has led to increased depression and suicide rates.”

Furthermore there was political discourse about the supposed suicide increase.  A narrative of “This tragic increase in suicide rates is awful, but we have to maintain the lockdown policies because even more lives will be lost to covid 19 if we don’t.”

This narrative would have been true even if the increase in suicides was real.  

But it turns out the obvious increase in suicides due to social isolation during the lockdowns wasn’t real at all when statisticians collated the evidence.  Something ‘everyone’ knew to be real wasn’t real at all.",0,negative
