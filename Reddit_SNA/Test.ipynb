      "Nobody, really. They have just picked up random comments from different leaders and people trying to solve this problem (what do we do if people deny the vaccine), applied it to a conclusion they already reached (NWO, Satan, globalist agenda, deep state, etc..) and have integrated that as a \"prediction\" into their worldview. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oddly enough, vaccines are already required for your kids to go to school for all other infectious diseases we have vaccines for, and we're not all under the thumb of a apocalyptic dystopia...but THIS time will be different....just watch....\n",
      "===============================================================================================================================\n",
      "That just infuriates me to no end. I just can't...wow. I need to go hit something.\n",
      "===============================================================================================================================\n",
      "I agree, but a couple points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We didn't KNOW it was overblown at the beginning. Hell, I remember seeing videos of people dying in the streets in China and Iran and was told *from the same conspiracy people  you see at these rallies* that it was 10x worse than the \"media\" was portraying it as. Obviously that didn't happen in major 1st world nations, but we still had NO idea what we were dealing with at the start. The overreaction is justified when you are faced with a novel pathogen and no time to study it, despite it actively spreading.\n",
      "2. We know more now. The lockdowns are largely over. What we've finally arrived at (after a lot of debate, because again, we had little information to go off of), is that life can return, but it must be done with precautions to reduce transmission while we wait for viable treatments or simply let the science catch up to itself once we have more stats on how it effects people. Ergo, masks and distancing (when possible).\n",
      "\n",
      "But no...these same people don't want that, either. They want life to continue unabated, even though they are simply not qualified to make that judgement call for the whole of society. They think it should just burn through the population so we can reach \"herd immunity\", despite that being something that has ONLY been achieved via a vaccine. In other pandemics prior, it simply caused a massive, massive death toll. **They are selfish pricks, who (ironically) would be the first to rush to the hospital if they or someone they loved was experiencing a severe case of COVID19.**\n",
      "\n",
      "The response to the rapid virus spread has been flawed; humans in general are flawed and mistakes are always made at every level of leadership for just about every issue we have faced. But that doesn't mean it was intentional, diabolical or malicious. And it doesn't mean that we should revert to \"normal life\" when it hasn't even been a full year of studying the new virus within the human body.\n",
      "===============================================================================================================================\n",
      "You're right that lockdowns are not a solution in ANY way; they stop life from from happening and that's just not a long-term option for any human society. So we need to get back to work, but we must do it safely; masks and distancing. Oh but what's that? These people ALSO don't want to do THAT, either? Well great. So they have made the decision *(because I'm sure they are all highly educated epidemiologists who've handled multiple pandemics successfully)* for society that it's not worth taking **any preventative measures** and we should just **let it burn through the populace without any regard**. All the while, allowing it to spread unabated even when the flu re-surges as it does every year *(and keep in mind, you can get BOTH of these diseases concurrently).* \n",
      "\n",
      "These paranoid (likely fundamentalist protestants), can get go get fucked. They are endangering society just because they have chosen to believe in a \"NWO Satanic Agenda\".\n",
      "===============================================================================================================================\n",
      "I was thinking the same thing. My wife god a horrible flu and still has lung damage from it. Her Aunt got a really bad flu and almost died from pneumonia. This has been proven, in the most conservative estimates, to be approx 5x WORSE than a \"bad flu\". \n",
      "\n",
      "The complicating factor is the unusually high asymptomatic rate of nearly 40% (we'll see in time though) and another significant percentage of \"mild cases\". The virus is clearly a roll of the dice and has caused a large amount of excess deaths, but I guess if it's not like ebola with a 50% CFR and causing people to die in the streets, it's simply not \"severe enough\" to warrant the measures we've taken to try and save lives (and I don't just mean deaths, either).\n",
      "===============================================================================================================================\n",
      "I agree. But to be fair, the protests here in the U.S. did not lead to a lot of cases, likely due to it being outdoors. I hope its the same here, because despite these people being absolute fucktards, I don't want them to get sick. I especially don't want them to take up a hospital bed in case someone who actually took this seriously, needs it.\n",
